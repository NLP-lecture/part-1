now,        a thing?
well,    good reasons  this.
first,     people turn  control   autonomous car,  autonomous car      good     human drivers.

question is, well,        500 years,       sooner  that?
50 years?
yeah, i   pretty       lots  robots everywhere.
fact i      a lot sooner  that.
i   st    cusp  robots  common,  i   sort   1978 or 1980  personal computer years,     robots  starting  appear.

big questions,  big questions  people   are:   make  robots    human-like,   accept them,       rights eventually?
question people   is,      over?
know,    a  hollywood me  lots  movies.   recognize  characters        cases, the robots   respect.
well,      give robots respect?
machines,  all.
i think,  know,    accept     machines.
all,    modern molecular biology   us.
a description  how,  know, molecule a,  know,    docks    molecule.
movg forward,  know, propelled   charges,    ul steps in  tweaks  molecules so   connect.
mechanistic.   mechanism.
maches,  in principle  let,      build machines    stuff,     alive as  are.
i     admit that,    give    special-ness,  a  way.
retre  special-ness   barrage  science  technology  times     hundred years, at least.
500 years a    give   idea     center   universe   earth started  go   sun; 150 years ago,  darwin,    give   idea     animals.
imagine   know,   hard  us.
recently   battered   idea         creati event,  on earth,  people   much.    human genome said,     35,000 genes.      people   that,    genes  that.
give   special-ness, so,  know,   idea  robots    emotions,   robots   living creatures  i      hard    accept.
accept     50 years  so.
question is,   machines    over?
stard scenario    create  things,  grow,  nurture them,  learn a lot  us, and   start  decide   pretty boring, slow.
us.
teenagers,     like.
hollywood extends    robots.
question is,  know,   accidentally build a robot  takes   us?
sort    lone guy   backyard,    "i accidentally built a 747."
i      happen.
i     i      deliberately build robots   uncomfortable with.
know,      a super bad robot.
a mildly bad robot,    a   bad robot.
way.
so, i     leave   that:  robots  coming,       worry about,     a lot  fun,  i hope   enjoy  journey    50 years.
