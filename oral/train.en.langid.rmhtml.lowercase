it can be a very complicated thing, the ocean.
and it can be a very complicated thing, what human health is.
and bringing those two together might seem a very daunting task, but what i'm going to try to say is that even in that complexity, there's some simple themes that i think, if we understand, we can really move forward.
and those simple themes aren't really themes about the complex science of what's going on, but things that we all pretty well know.
and i'm going to start with this one: if momma ain't happy, ain't nobody happy.
we know that, right? we've experienced that.
and if we just take that and we build from there, then we can go to the next step, which is that if the ocean ain't happy, ain't nobody happy.
that's the theme of my talk.
and we're making the ocean pretty unhappy in a lot of different ways.
this is a shot of cannery row in 1932.
cannery row, at the time, had the biggest industrial canning operation on the west coast.
we piled enormous amounts of pollution into the air and into the water.
rolf bolin, who was a professor at the hopkin's marine station where i work, wrote in the 1940s that "the fumes from the scum floating on the inlets of the bay were so bad they turned lead-based paints black."
people working in these canneries could barely stay there all day because of the smell, but you know what they came out saying?
they say, "you know what you smell?
you smell money."
that pollution was money to that community, and those people dealt with the pollution and absorbed it into their skin and into their bodies because they needed the money.
we made the ocean unhappy; we made people very unhappy, and we made them unhealthy.
the connection between ocean health and human health is actually based upon another couple simple adages, and i want to call that "pinch a minnow, hurt a whale."
the pyramid of ocean life ...
now, when an ecologist looks at the ocean -- i have to tell you -- we look at the ocean in a very different way, and we see different things than when a regular person looks at the ocean because when an ecologist looks at the ocean, we see all those interconnections.
we see the base of the food chain, the plankton, the small things, and we see how those animals are food to animals in the middle of the pyramid, and on so up this diagram.
and that flow, that flow of life, from the very base up to the very top, is the flow that ecologists see.
and that's what we're trying to preserve when we say, "save the ocean. heal the ocean."
it's that pyramid.
now why does that matter for human health?
because when we jam things in the bottom of that pyramid that shouldn't be there, some very frightening things happen.
pollutants, some pollutants have been created by us: molecules like pcbs that can't be broken down by our bodies.
and they go in the base of that pyramid, and they drift up; they're passed up that way, on to predators and on to the top predators, and in so doing, they accumulate.
now, to bring that home, i thought i'd invent a little game.
we don't really have to play it; we can just think about it here.
it's the styrofoam and chocolate game.
imagine that when we got on this boat, we were all given two styrofoam peanuts.
can't do much with them: put them in your pocket.
suppose the rules are: every time you offer somebody a drink, you give them the drink, and you give them your styrofoam peanuts too.
what'll happen is that the styrofoam peanuts will start moving through our society here, and they will accumulate in the drunkest, stingiest people.
there's no mechanism in this game for them to go anywhere but into a bigger and bigger pile of indigestible styrofoam peanuts.
and that's exactly what happens with pdbs in this food pyramid: they accumulate into the top of it.
now suppose, instead of styrofoam peanuts, we take these lovely little chocolates that we get and we had those instead.
well, some of us would be eating those chocolates instead of passing them around, and instead of accumulating, they will just pass into our group here and not accumulate in any one group because they're absorbed by us.
and that's the difference between a pcb and, say, something natural like an omega-3, something we want out of the marine food chain.
pcbs accumulate.
we have great examples of that, unfortunately.
pcbs accumulate in dolphins in sarasota bay, in texas, in north carolina.
they get into the food chain.
the dolphins eat the fish that have pcbs from the plankton, and those pcbs, being fat-soluble, accumulate in these dolphins.
now, a dolphin, mother dolphin, any dolphin -- there's only one way that a pcb can get out of a dolphin.
and what's that?
in mother's milk.
here's a diagram of the pcb load of dolphins in sarasota bay.
adult males: a huge load.
juveniles: a huge load.
females after their first calf is already weaned: a lower load.
those females, they're not trying to.
those females are passing the pcbs in the fat of their own mother's milk into their offspring, and their offspring don't survive.
the death rate in these dolphins, for the first calf born of every female dolphin, is 60 to 80 percent.
these mothers pump their first offspring full of this pollutant, and most of them die.
now, the mother then can go and reproduce, but what a terrible price to pay for the accumulation of this pollutant in these animals -- the death of the first-born calf.
there's another top predator in the ocean, it turns out.
that top predator, of course, is us.
and we also are eating meat that comes from some of these same places.
this is whale meat that i photographed in a grocery store in tokyo -- or is it?
in fact, what we did a few years ago was learn how to smuggle a molecular biology lab into tokyo and use it to genetically test the dna out of whale meat samples and identify what they really were.
and some of those whale meat samples were whale meat.
some of them were illegal whale meat, by the way.
that's another story.
but some of them were not whale meat at all.
even though they were labeled whale meat, they were dolphin meat.
some of them were dolphin liver. some of them were dolphin blubber.
and those dolphin parts had a huge load of pcbs, dioxins and heavy metals.
and that huge load was passing into the people that ate this meat.
it turns out that a lot of dolphins are being sold as meat in the whale meat market around the world.
that's a tragedy for those populations, but it's also a tragedy for the people eating them because they don't know that that's toxic meat.
we had these data a few years ago.
i remember sitting at my desk being about the only person in the world who knew that whale meat being sold in these markets was really dolphin meat, and it was toxic.
it had two-to-three-to-400 times the toxic loads ever allowed by the epa.
and i remember there sitting at my desk thinking, "well, i know this. this is a great scientific discovery," but it was so awful.
and for the very first time in my scientific career, i broke scientific protocol, which is that you take the data and publish them in scientific journals and then begin to talk about them.
we sent a very polite letter to the minister of health in japan and simply pointed out that this is an intolerable situation, not for us, but for the people of japan because mothers who may be breastfeeding, who may have young children, would be buying something that they thought was healthy, but it was really toxic.
that led to a whole series of other campaigns in japan, and i'm really proud to say that at this point, it's very difficult to buy anything in japan that's labeled incorrectly, even though they're still selling whale meat, which i believe they shouldn't.
but at least it's labeled correctly, and you're no longer going to be buying toxic dolphin meat instead.
it isn't just there that this happens, but in a natural diet of some communities in the canadian arctic and in the united states and in the european arctic, a natural diet of seals and whales leads to an accumulation of pcbs that have gathered up from all parts of the world and ended up in these women.
these women have toxic breast milk.
they cannot feed their offspring, their children, their breast milk because of the accumulation of these toxins in their food chain, in their part of the world's ocean pyramid.
that means their immune systems are compromised.
it means that their children's development can be compromised.
and the world's attention on this over the last decade has reduced the problem for these women, not by changing the pyramid, but by changing what they particularly eat out of it.
we've taken them out of their natural pyramid in order to solve this problem.
that's a good thing for this particular acute problem, but it does nothing to solve the pyramid problem.
there's other ways of breaking the pyramid.
the pyramid, if we jam things in the bottom, can get backed up like a sewer line that's clogged.
and if we jam nutrients, sewage, fertilizer in the base of that food pyramid, it can back up all through it.
we end up with things we've heard about before: red tides, for example, which are blooms of toxic algae floating through the oceans causing neurological damage.
we can also see blooms of bacteria, blooms of viruses in the ocean.
these are two shots of a red tide coming on shore here and a bacteria in the genus vibrio, which includes the genus that has cholera in it.
how many people have seen a "beach closed" sign?
why does that happen?
it happens because we have jammed so much into the base of the natural ocean pyramid that these bacteria clog it up and overfill onto our beaches.
often what jams us up is sewage.
now how many of you have ever gone to a state park or a national park where you had a big sign at the front saying, "closed because human sewage is so far over this park that you can't use it"?
not very often. we wouldn't tolerate that.
we wouldn't tolerate our parks being swamped by human sewage, but beaches are closed a lot in our country.
they're closed more and more and more all around the world for the same reason, and i believe we shouldn't tolerate that either.
it's not just a question of cleanliness; it's also a question of how those organisms then turn into human disease.
these vibrios, these bacteria, can actually infect people.
they can go into your skin and create skin infections.
this is a graph from noaa's ocean and human health initiative, showing the rise of the infections by vibrio in people over the last few years.
surfers, for example, know this incredibly.
and if you can see on some surfing sites, in fact, not only do you see what the waves are like or what the weather's like, but on some surf rider sites, you see a little flashing poo alert.
that means that the beach might have great waves, but it's a dangerous place for surfers to be because they can carry with them, even after a great day of surfing, this legacy of an infection that might take a very long time to solve.
some of these infections are actually carrying antibiotic resistance genes now, and that makes them even more difficult.
these same infections create harmful algal blooms.
those blooms are generating other kinds of chemicals.
this is just a simple list of some of the types of poisons that come out of these harmful algal blooms: shellfish poisoning,fish ciguatera, diarrheic shellfish poisoning -- you don't want to know about that -- neurotoxic shellfish poisoning, paralytic shellfish poisoning.
these are things that are getting into our food chain because of these blooms.
rita calwell very famously traced a very interesting story of cholera into human communities, brought there, not by a normal human vector, but by a marine vector, this copepod.
copepods are small crustaceans.
they're a tiny fraction of an inch long, and they can carry on their little legs some of the cholera bacteria that then leads to human disease.
that has sparked cholera epidemics in ports along the world and has led to increased concentration on trying to make sure shipping doesn't move these vectors of cholera around the world.
so what do you do?
we have major problems in disrupted ecosystem flow that the pyramid may not be working so well, that the flow from the base up into it is being blocked and clogged.
what do you do when you have this sort of disrupted flow?
well, there's a bunch of things you could do.
you could call joe the plumber, for example.
and he could come in and fix the flow.
but in fact, if you look around the world, not only are there hope spots for where we may be able to fix problems, there have been places where problems have been fixed, where people have come to grips with these issues and begun to turn them around.
monterey is one of those.
i started out showing how much we had distressed the monterey bay ecosystem with pollution and the canning industry and all of the attendant problems.
in 1932, that's the picture.
in 2009, the picture is dramatically different.
the canneries are gone. the pollution has abated.
but there's a greater sense here that what the individual communities need is working ecosystems.
they need a functioning pyramid from the base all the way to the top.
and that pyramid in monterey, right now, because of the efforts of a lot of different people, is functioning better than it's ever functioned for the last 150 years.
it didn't happen accidentally.
it happened because many people put their time and effort and their pioneering spirit into this.
on the left there, julia platt, the mayor of my little hometown in pacific grove.
at 74 years old, became mayor because something had to be done to protect the ocean.
in 1931, she produced california's first community-based marine protected area, right next to the biggest polluting cannery, because julia knew that when the canneries eventually were gone, the ocean needed a place to grow from, that the ocean needed a place to spark a seed, and she wanted to provide that seed.
other people, like david packard and julie packard, who were instrumental in producing the monterey bay aquarium to lock into people's notion that the ocean and the health of the ocean ecosystem were just as important to the economy of this area as eating the ecosystem would be.
that change in thinking has led to a dramatic shift, not only in the fortunes of monterey bay, but other places around the world.
well, i want to leave you with the thought that what we're really trying to do here is protect this ocean pyramid, and that ocean pyramid connects to our own pyramid of life.
it's an ocean planet, and we think of ourselves as a terrestrial species, but the pyramid of life in the ocean and our own lives on land are intricately connected.
and it's only through having the ocean being healthy that we can remain healthy ourselves.
thank you very much.
stephen palumbi: following the mercury trail
there's a tight and surprising link between the ocean's health and ours, says marine biologist stephen palumbi. he shows how toxins at the bottom of the ocean food chain find their way into our bodies, with a shocking story of toxic contamination from a japanese fish market. his work points a way forward for saving the oceans' health -- and humanity's.
adrian kohler: well, we're here today to talk about the evolution of a puppet horse.
basil jones: but actually we're going to start this evolution with a hyena.
ak: the ancestor of the horse.
okay, we'll do something with it.
the hyena is the ancestor of the horse because it was part of a production called "faustus in africa," a handspring production from 1995, where it had to play draughts with helen of troy.
this production was directed by south african artist and theater director, william kentridge.
so it needed a very articulate front paw.
but, like all puppets, it has other attributes.
bj: one of them is breath, and it kind of breathes.
ak: haa haa haaa.
bj: breath is really important for us.
it's the kind of original movement for any puppet for us onstage.
it's the thing that distinguishes the puppet -- ak: oops.
bj: from an actor.
puppets always have to try to be alive.
it's their kind of ur-story onstage, that desperation to live.
ak: yeah, it's basically a dead object, as you can see, and it only lives because you make it.
an actor struggles to die onstage, but a puppet has to struggle to live.
and in a way that's a metaphor for life.
bj: so every moment it's on the stage, it's making the struggle.
so we call this a piece of emotional engineering that uses up-to-the-minute 17th century technology -- to turn nouns into verbs.
ak: well actually i prefer to say that it's an object constructed out of wood and cloth with movement built into it to persuade you to believe that it has life.
ak: it has ears that move passively when the head goes.
bj: and it has these bulkheads made out of plywood, covered with fabric -- curiously similar, in fact, to the plywood canoes that adrian's father used to make when he was a boy in their workshop.
ak: in port elizabeth, the village outside port elizabeth in south africa.
bj: his mother was a puppeteer.
and when we met at art school and fell in love in 1971, i hated puppets.
i really thought they were so beneath me.
i wanted to become an avant-garde artist -- and punch and judy was certainly not where i wanted to go.
and, in fact, it took about 10 years to discover the bambara bamana puppets of mali in west africa, where there's a fabulous tradition of puppetry, to learn a renewed, or a new, respect for this art form.
ak: so in 1981, i persuaded basil and some friends of mine to form a puppet company.
and 20 years later, miraculously, we collaborated with a company from mali, the sogolon marionette troupe of bamako, where we made a piece about a tall giraffe.
it was just called "tall horse," which was a life-sized giraffe.
bj: and here again, you see the same structure.
the bulkheads have now turned into hoops of cane, but it's ultimately the same structure.
it's got two people inside it on stilts, which give them the height, and somebody in the front who's using a kind of steering wheel to move that head.
ak: the person in the hind legs is also controlling the tail, a bit like the hyena -- same mechanism, just a bit bigger.
and he's controlling the ear movement.
bj: so this production was seen by tom morris of the national theatre in london.
and just around that time, his mother had said, "have you seen this book by michael morpurgo called 'war horse'?"
ak: it's about a boy who falls in love with a horse.
the horse is sold to the first world war, and he joins up to find his horse.
bj: so tom gave us a call and said, "do you think you could make us a horse for a show to happen at the national theatre?"
ak: it seemed a lovely idea.
bj: but it had to ride. it had to have a rider.
ak: it had to have a rider, and it had to participate in cavalry charges.
a play about early 20th century plowing technology and cavalry charges was a little bit of a challenge for the accounting department at the national theatre in london.
but they agreed to go along with it for a while.
so we began with a test.
bj: this is adrian and thys stander, who went on to actually design the cane system for the horse, and our next-door neighbor katherine, riding on a ladder.
the weight is really difficult when it's up above your head.
ak: and once we put katherine through that particular brand of hell, we knew that we might be able to make a horse, which could be ridden.
so we made a model.
this is a cardboard model, a little bit smaller than the hyena.
you'll notice that the legs are plywood legs and the canoe structure is still there.
bj: and the two manipulators are inside.
but we didn't realize at the time that we actually needed a third manipulator, because we couldn't manipulate the neck from inside and walk the horse at the same time.
ak: we started work on the prototype after the model was approved, and the prototype took a bit longer than we anticipated.
we had to throw out the plywood legs and make new cane ones.
and we had a crate built for it.
it had to be shipped to london.
we were going to test-drive it on the street outside of our house in cape town, and it got to midnight and we hadn't done that yet.
bj: so we got a camera, and we posed the puppet in various galloping stances.
and we sent it off to the national theatre, hoping that they believed that we created something that worked.
ak: a month later, we were there in london with this big box and a studio full of people about to work with us.
bj: about 40 people.
we opened the lid, we took the horse out, and it did work; it walked and it was able to be ridden.
here i have an 18-second clip of the very first walk of the prototype.
this is in the national theatre studio, the place where they cook new ideas.
it had by no means got the green light yet.
the choreographer, toby sedgwick, invented a beautiful sequence where the baby horse, which was made out of sticks and bits of twigs, grew up into the big horse.
and nick starr, the director of the national theatre, saw that particular moment, he was standing next to me -- he nearly wet himself.
and so the show was given the green light.
and we went back to cape town and redesigned the horse completely.
here is the plan.
and here is our factory in cape town where we make horses.
you can see quite a lot of skeletons in the background there.
the horses are completely handmade.
there is very little 20th century technology in them.
we used a bit of laser cutting on the plywood and some of the aluminum pieces.
but because they have to be light and flexible, and each one of them is different, they can't be mass-produced, unfortunately.
so here are some half-finished horses ready to be worked in london.
and now we would like to introduce you to joey.
joey boy, you there?
joey, come here.
no, no, i haven't got it.
he's got it; it's in his pocket.
come here. stand here where people can see you.
i'd just like to describe -- i won't talk too loud. he might get irritated.
here, craig is working the head.
he has bicycle brake cables going down to the head control in his hand.
each one of them operates either an ear, separately, or the head, up and down.
but he also controls the head directly by using his hand.
the ears are obviously a very important emotional indicator of the horse.
when they point right back, the horse is fearful or angry, depending upon what's going on in front of him, around him.
or, when he's more relaxed, the head comes down and the ears listen, either side.
horses' hearing is very important.
it's almost more important than their eyesight.
over here, tommy's got what you call the heart position.
he's working the leg.
you see the string tendon from the hyena, the hyena's front leg, automatically pulls the hoop up.
horses are so unpredictable.
the way a hoof comes up with a horse immediately gives you the feeling that it's a convincing horse action.
the hind legs have got the same action.
bj: and mikey also has, in his fingers, the ability to move the tail from left to right, and up and down with the other hand.
and together, there's quite a complex possibility of tail expression.
ak: you want to say something about the breathing?
bj: we had a big challenge with breathing.
adrian thought that he was going to have to split the chest of the puppet in two and make it breathe like that -- because that's how a horse would breathe, with an expanded chest.
but we realized that, if that were to be happening, you wouldn't, as an audience, see the breath.
so he made a channel in here, and the chest moves up and down in that channel.
so it's anti-naturalistic really, the up and down movement, but it feels like breath.
and it's very, very simple because all that happens is that the puppeteer breathes with his knees.
ak: other emotional stuff.
if i were to touch the horse here on his skin, the heart puppeteer can shake the body from inside and get the skin to quiver.
you'll notice, of course, that the puppet is made out of cane lines.
and i would like you to believe that it was an aesthetic choice, that i was making a three-dimensional drawing of a horse that somehow moves in space.
but of course, it was the cane is light, the cane is flexible, the cane is durable and the cane is moldable.
and so it was a very practical reason why it was made of cane.
the skin itself is made out of a see-through nylon mesh, which, if the lighting designer wants the horse to almost disappear, she can light the background and the horse becomes ghostlike.
you see the skeletal structure of it.
or if you light it from above, it becomes more solid.
again, that was a practical consideration.
the guys inside the horse have to be able to see out.
they have to be able to act along with their fellow actors in the production.
and it's very much an in-the-moment activity that they're engaged in.
it's three heads making one character.
but now we would like you to put joey through some paces.
and plant.
and now just -- all the way from sunny california we have zem joaquin who's going to ride the horse for us.
so we would like to stress that the performance you see in the horse is three guys who have studied horse behavior incredibly thoroughly.
bj: not being able to talk to one another while they're onstage because they're mic'd.
the sound that that very large chest makes, of the horse -- the whinnying and the nickering and everything -- that starts usually with one performer, carries on with a second person and ends with a third.
ak: mikey brett from leicestershire.
mikey brett, craig, leo, zem joaquin and basil and me.
thank you. thank you.
handspring puppet co.: the genius puppetry behind war horse
"puppets always have to try to be alive," says adrian kohler of the handspring puppet company, a gloriously ambitious troupe of human and wooden actors. beginning with the tale of a hyena's subtle paw, puppeteers kohler and basil jones build to the story of their latest astonishment: the wonderfully life-like joey, the war horse, who trots convincingly onto the stage.
let's start with day and night.
life evolved under conditions of light and darkness, light and then darkness.
and so plants and animals developed their own internal clocks so that they would be ready for these changes in light.
these are chemical clocks, and they're found in every known being that has two or more cells and in some that only have one cell.
i'll give you an example -- if you take a horseshoe crab off the beach, and you fly it all the way across the continent, and you drop it into a sloped cage, it will scramble up the floor of the cage as the tide is rising on its home shores, and it'll skitter down again right as the water is receding thousands of miles away.
it'll do this for weeks, until it kind of gradually loses the plot.
and it's incredible to watch, but there's nothing psychic or paranormal going on; it's simply that these crabs have internal cycles that correspond, usually, with what's going on around it.
so, we have this ability as well.
and in humans, we call it the "body clock."
you can see this most clearly when you take away someone's watch and you shut them into a bunker, deep underground, for a couple of months.
people actually volunteer for this, and they usually come out kind of raving about their productive time in the hole.
so, no matter how atypical these subjects would have to be, they all show the same thing.
they get up just a little bit later every day -- say 15 minutes or so -- and they kind of drift all the way around the clock like this over the course of the weeks.
and so, in this way we know that they are working on their own internal clocks, rather than somehow sensing the day outside.
so fine, we have a body clock, and it turns out that it's incredibly important in our lives.
it's a huge driver for culture and i think that it's the most underrated force on our behavior.
we evolved as a species near the equator, and so we're very well-equipped to deal with 12 hours of daylight and 12 hours of darkness.
but of course, we've spread to every corner of the globe and in arctic canada, where i live, we have perpetual daylight in summer and 24 hours of darkness in winter.
so the culture, the northern aboriginal culture, traditionally has been highly seasonal.
in winter, there's a lot of sleeping going on; you enjoy your family life inside.
and in summer, it's almost manic hunting and working activity very long hours, very active.
so, what would our natural rhythm look like?
what would our sleeping patterns be in the sort of ideal sense?
well, it turns out that when people are living without any sort of artificial light at all, they sleep twice every night.
they go to bed around 8:00 p.m.
until midnight and then again, they sleep from about 2:00 a.m. until sunrise.
and in-between, they have a couple of hours of sort of meditative quiet in bed.
and during this time, there's a surge of prolactin, the likes of which a modern day never sees.
the people in these studies report feeling so awake during the daytime, that they realize they're experiencing true wakefulness for the first time in their lives.
so, cut to the modern day.
we're living in a culture of jet lag, global travel, 24-hour business, shift work.
and you know, our modern ways of doing things have their advantages, but i believe we should understand the costs.
jessa gamble: our natural sleep cycle
in today's world, balancing school, work, kids and more, most of us can only hope for the recommended eight hours of sleep. examining the science behind our body's internal clock, jessa gamble reveals the surprising and substantial program of rest we should be observing.
i want you to, for a moment, think about playing a game of monopoly, except in this game, that combination of skill, talent and luck that help earn you success in games, as in life, has been rendered irrelevant, because this game's been rigged, and you've got the upper hand.
you've got more money, more opportunities to move around the board, and more access to resources.
and as you think about that experience, i want you to ask yourself, how might that experience of being a privileged player in a rigged game change the way that you think about yourself and regard that other player?
so we ran a study on the u.c. berkeley campus to look at exactly that question.
we brought in more than 100 pairs of strangers into the lab, and with the flip of a coin randomly assigned one of the two to be a rich player in a rigged game.
they got two times as much money.
when they passed go, they collected twice the salary, and they got to roll both dice instead of one, so they got to move around the board a lot more.
and over the course of 15 minutes, we watched through hidden cameras what happened.
and what i want to do today, for the first time, is show you a little bit of what we saw.
you're going to have to pardon the sound quality, in some cases, because again, these were hidden cameras.
so we've provided subtitles.
rich player: how many 500s did you have?
poor player: just one.
rich player: are you serious. poor player: yeah.
rich player: i have three.
i don't know why they gave me so much.
paul piff: okay, so it was quickly apparent to players that something was up.
one person clearly has a lot more money than the other person, and yet, as the game unfolded, we saw very notable differences and dramatic differences begin to emerge between the two players.
the rich player started to move around the board louder, literally smacking the board with their piece as he went around.
we were more likely to see signs of dominance and nonverbal signs, displays of power and celebration among the rich players.
we had a bowl of pretzels positioned off to the side.
it's on the bottom right corner there.
that allowed us to watch participants' consummatory behavior.
so we're just tracking how many pretzels participants eat.
rich player: are those pretzels a trick?
poor player: i don't know.
pp: okay, so no surprises, people are onto us.
they wonder what that bowl of pretzels is doing there in the first place.
one even asks, like you just saw, is that bowl of pretzels there as a trick?
and yet, despite that, the power of the situation seems to inevitably dominate, and those rich players start to eat more pretzels.
pp: and as the game went on, one of the really interesting and dramatic patterns that we observed begin to emerge was that the rich players actually started to become ruder toward the other person, less and less sensitive to the plight of those poor, poor players, and more and more demonstrative of their material success, more likely to showcase how well they're doing.
rich player: i have money for everything.
poor player: how much is that?
rich player: you owe me 24 dollars.
you're going to lose all your money soon.
i'll buy it. i have so much money.
i have so much money, it takes me forever.
rich player 2: i'm going to buy out this whole board.
rich player 3: you're going to run out of money soon.
i'm pretty much untouchable at this point.
pp: okay, and here's what i think was really, really interesting, is that at the end of the 15 minutes, we asked the players to talk about their experience during the game.
and when the rich players talked about why they had inevitably won in this rigged game of monopoly -- — they talked about what they'd done to buy those different properties and earn their success in the game, and they became far less attuned to all those different features of the situation, including that flip of a coin that had randomly gotten them into that privileged position in the first place.
and that's a really, really incredible insight into how the mind makes sense of advantage.
now this game of monopoly can be used as a metaphor for understanding society and its hierarchical structure, wherein some people have a lot of wealth and a lot of status, and a lot of people don't.
they have a lot less wealth and a lot less status and a lot less access to valued resources.
and what my colleagues and i for the last seven years have been doing is studying the effects of these kinds of hierarchies.
what we've been finding across dozens of studies and thousands of participants across this country is that as a person's levels of wealth increase, their feelings of compassion and empathy go down, and their feelings of entitlement, of deservingness, and their ideology of self-interest increases.
in surveys, we found that it's actually wealthier individuals who are more likely to moralize greed being good, and that the pursuit of self-interest is favorable and moral.
now what i want to do today is talk about some of the implications of this ideology self-interest, talk about why we should care about those implications, and end with what might be done.
some of the first studies that we ran in this area looked at helping behavior, something social psychologists call pro-social behavior.
and we were really interested in who's more likely to offer help to another person, someone who's rich or someone who's poor.
in one of the studies, we bring in rich and poor members of the community into the lab and give each of them the equivalent of 10 dollars.
we told the participants that they could keep these 10 dollars for themselves, or they could share a portion of it, if they wanted to, with a stranger who is totally anonymous.
they'll never meet that stranger and the stranger will never meet them.
and we just monitor how much people give.
individuals who made 25,000 sometimes under 15,000 dollars a year, gave 44 percent more of their money to the stranger than did individuals making 150,000 or 200,000 dollars a year.
we've had people play games to see who's more or less likely to cheat to increase their chances of winning a prize.
in one of the games, we actually rigged a computer so that die rolls over a certain score were impossible.
you couldn't get above 12 in this game, and yet, the richer you were, the more likely you were to cheat in this game to earn credits toward a $50 cash prize, sometimes by three to four times as much.
we ran another study where we looked at whether people would be inclined to take candy from a jar of candy that we explicitly identified as being reserved for children -- — participating -- i'm not kidding.
i know it sounds like i'm making a joke.
we explicitly told participants this jar of candy's for children participating in a developmental lab nearby.
they're in studies. this is for them.
and we just monitored how much candy participants took.
participants who felt rich took two times as much candy as participants who felt poor.
we've even studied cars, not just any cars, but whether drivers of different kinds of cars are more or less inclined to break the law.
in one of these studies, we looked at whether drivers would stop for a pedestrian that we had posed waiting to cross at a crosswalk.
now in california, as you all know, because i'm sure we all do this, it's the law to stop for a pedestrian who's waiting to cross.
so here's an example of how we did it.
that's our confederate off to the left posing as a pedestrian.
he approaches as the red truck successfully stops.
in typical california fashion, it's overtaken by the bus who almost runs our pedestrian over.
now here's an example of a more expensive car, a prius, driving through, and a bmw doing the same.
so we did this for hundreds of vehicles on several days, just tracking who stops and who doesn't.
what we found was that as the expensiveness of a car increased, the driver's tendencies to break the law increased as well.
none of the cars, none of the cars in our least expensive car category broke the law.
close to 50 percent of the cars in our most expensive vehicle category broke the law.
we've run other studies finding that wealthier individuals are more likely to lie in negotiations, to endorse unethical behavior at work like stealing cash from the cash register, taking bribes, lying to customers.
now i don't mean to suggest that it's only wealthy people who show these patterns of behavior.
not at all. in fact, i think that we all, in our day-to-day, minute-by-minute lives, struggle with these competing motivations of when, or if, to put our own interests above the interests of other people.
and that's understandable because the american dream is an idea in which we all have an equal opportunity to succeed and prosper, as long as we apply ourselves and work hard, and a piece of that means that sometimes, you need to put your own interests above the interests and well-being of other people around you.
but what we're finding is that, the wealthier you are, the more likely you are to pursue a vision of personal success, of achievement and accomplishment, to the detriment of others around you.
here i've plotted for you the mean household income received by each fifth and top five percent of the population over the last 20 years.
in 1993, the differences between the different quintiles of the population, in terms of income, are fairly egregious.
it's not difficult to discern that there are differences.
but over the last 20 years, that significant difference has become a grand canyon of sorts between those at the top and everyone else.
in fact, the top 20 percent of our population own close to 90 percent of the total wealth in this country.
we're at unprecedented levels of economic inequality.
what that means is that wealth is not only becoming increasingly concentrated in the hands of a select group of individuals, but the american dream is becoming increasingly unattainable for an increasing majority of us.
and if it's the case, as we've been finding, that the wealthier you are, the more entitled you feel to that wealth, and the more likely you are to prioritize your own interests above the interests of other people, and be willing to do things to serve that self-interest, well then there's no reason to think that those patterns will change.
in fact, there's every reason to think that they'll only get worse, and that's what it would look like if things just stayed the same, at the same linear rate, over the next 20 years.
now, inequality, economic inequality, is something we should all be concerned about, and not just because of those at the bottom of the social hierarchy, but because individuals and groups with lots of economic inequality do worse, not just the people at the bottom, everyone.
there's a lot of really compelling research coming out from top labs all over the world showcasing the range of things that are undermined as economic inequality gets worse.
social mobility, things we really care about, physical health, social trust, all go down as inequality goes up.
similarly, negative things in social collectives and societies, things like obesity, and violence, imprisonment, and punishment, are exacerbated as economic inequality increases.
again, these are outcomes not just experienced by a few, but that resound across all strata of society.
even people at the top experience these outcomes.
so what do we do?
this cascade of self-perpetuating, pernicious, negative effects could seem like something that's spun out of control, and there's nothing we can do about it, certainly nothing we as individuals could do.
but in fact, we've been finding in our own laboratory research that small psychological interventions, small changes to people's values, small nudges in certain directions, can restore levels of egalitarianism and empathy.
for instance, reminding people of the benefits of cooperation, or the advantages of community, cause wealthier individuals to be just as egalitarian as poor people.
in one study, we had people watch a brief video, just 46 seconds long, about childhood poverty that served as a reminder of the needs of others in the world around them, and after watching that, we looked at how willing people were to offer up their own time to a stranger presented to them in the lab who was in distress.
after watching this video, an hour later, rich people became just as generous of their own time to help out this other person, a stranger, as someone who's poor, suggesting that these differences are not innate or categorical, but are so malleable to slight changes in people's values, and little nudges of compassion and bumps of empathy.
and beyond the walls of our lab, we're even beginning to see signs of change in society.
bill gates, one of our nation's wealthiest individuals, in his harvard commencement speech, talked about the problem facing society of inequality as being the most daunting challenge, and talked about what must be done to combat it, saying, "humanity's greatest advances are not in its discoveries, but in how those discoveries are applied to reduce inequity."
and there's the giving pledge, in which more than 100 of our nation's wealthiest individuals are pledging half of their fortunes to charity.
and there's the emergence of dozens of grassroots movements, like we are the one percent, the resource generation, or wealth for common good, in which the most privileged members of the population, members of the one percent and elsewhere, people who are wealthy, are using their own economic resources, adults and youth alike, that's what's most striking to me, leveraging their own privilege, their own economic resources, to combat inequality by advocating for social policies, changes in social values, and changes in people's behavior, that work against their own economic interests but that may ultimately restore the american dream.
paul piff: does money make you mean?
it's amazing what a rigged game of monopoly can reveal. in this entertaining but sobering talk, social psychologist paul piff shares his research into how people behave when they feel wealthy. but while the problem of inequality is a complex and daunting challenge, there's good news too.
i want to help you re-perceive what philanthropy is, what it could be, and what your relationship to it is.
and in doing that, i want to offer you a vision, an imagined future, if you will, of how, as the poet seamus heaney has put it, "once in a lifetime the longed-for tidal wave of justice can rise up, and hope and history rhyme."
i want to start with these word pairs here.
we all know which side of these we'd like to be on.
when philanthropy was reinvented a century ago, when the foundation form was actually invented, they didn't think of themselves on the wrong side of these either.
in fact they would never have thought of themselves as closed and set in their ways, as slow to respond to new challenges, as small and risk-averse.
and in fact they weren't. they were reinventing charity in those times, what rockefeller called "the business of benevolence."
but by the end of the 20th century, a new generation of critics and reformers had come to see philanthropy just this way.
the thing to watch for as a global philanthropy industry comes about -- and that's exactly what is happening -- is how the aspiration is to flip these old assumptions, for philanthropy to become open and big and fast and connected, in service of the long term.
this entrepreneurial energy is emerging from many quarters.
and it's driven and propelled forward by new leaders, like many of the people here, by new tools, like the ones we've seen here, and by new pressures.
i've been following this change for quite a while now, and participating in it.
this report is our main public report.
what it tells is the story of how today actually could be as historic as 100 years ago.
what i want to do is share some of the coolest things that are going on with you.
and as i do that, i'm not going to dwell much on the very large philanthropy that everybody already knows about -- the gates or the soros or the google.
instead, what i want to do is talk about the philanthropy of all of us: the democratization of philanthropy.
this is a moment in history when the average person has more power than at any time.
what i'm going to do is look at five categories of experiments, each of which challenges an old assumption of philanthropy.
the first is mass collaboration, represented here by wikipedia.
now, this may surprise you.
but remember, philanthropy is about giving of time and talent, not just money.
clay shirky, that great chronicler of everything networked, has captured the assumption that this challenges in such a beautiful way.
he said, "we have lived in this world where little things are done for love and big things for money.
now we have wikipedia.
suddenly big things can be done for love."
watch, this spring, for paul hawken's new book -- author and entrepreneur many of you may know about.
the book is called "blessed unrest."
and when it comes out, a series of wiki sites under the label wiser, are going to launch at the same time.
wiser stands for world index for social and environmental responsibility.
wiser sets out to document, link and empower what paul calls the largest movement, and fastest-growing movement in human history: humanity's collective immune response to today's threats.
now, all of these big things for love -- experiments -- aren't going to take off.
but the ones that do are going to be the biggest, the most open, the fastest, the most connected form of philanthropy in human history.
second category is online philanthropy marketplaces.
this is, of course, to philanthropy what ebay and amazon are to commerce.
think of it as peer-to-peer philanthropy.
and this challenges yet another assumption, which is that organized philanthropy is only for the very wealthy.
take a look, if you haven't, at donorschoose.
omidyar network has made a big investment in donorschoose.
it's one of the best known of these new marketplaces where a donor can go straight into a classroom and connect with what a teacher says they need.
take a look at changing the present, started by a tedster, next time you need a wedding present or a holiday present.
giveindia is for a whole country.
and it goes on and on.
the third category is represented by warren buffet, which i call aggregated giving.
it's not just that warren buffet was so amazingly generous in that historic act last summer.
it's that he challenged another assumption, that every giver should have his or her own fund or foundation.
there are now, today, so many new funds that are aggregating giving and investing, bringing together people around a common goal, to think bigger.
one of the best known is acumen fund, led by jacqueline novogratz, a tedster who got a big boost here at ted.
but there are many others: new profit in cambridge, new school's venture fund in silicon valley, venture philanthropy partners in washington, global fund for women in san francisco.
take a look at these.
these funds are to philanthropy what venture capital, private equity, and eventually mutual funds are to investing, but with a twist -- because often a community forms around these funds, as it has at acumen and other places.
now, imagine for a second these first three types of experiments: mass collaboration, online marketplaces, aggregated giving.
and understand how they help us re-perceive what organized philanthropy is.
it's not about foundations necessarily; it's about the rest of us.
and imagine the mash-up, if you will, of these things, in the future, when these things come together in the experiments of the future -- imagine that somebody puts up, say, 100 million dollars for an inspiring goal -- there were 21 gifts of 100 million dollars or more in the us last year, not out of the question -- but only puts it up if it's matched by millions of small gifts from around the globe, thereby engaging lots of people, and building visibility and engaging people in the goal that's stated.
i'm going to look quickly at the fourth and fifth categories, which are innovation, competitions and social investing.
they're betting a visible competition, a prize, can attract talent and money to some of the most difficult issues, and thereby speed the solution.
this tackles yet another assumption, that the giver and the organization is at the center, as opposed to putting the problem at the center.
you can look to these innovators to help us especially with things that require technological or scientific solution.
that leaves the final category, social investing, which is really, anyway, the biggest of them all, represented here by xigi.net.
and this, of course, tackles the biggest assumption of all, that business is business, and philanthropy is the vehicle of people who want to create change in the world.
xigi is a new community site that's built by the community, linking and mapping this new social capital market.
it lists already 1,000 entities that are offering debt and equity for social enterprise.
so we can look to these innovators to help us remember that if we can leverage even a small amount of the capital that seeks a return, the good that can be driven could be astonishing.
now, what's really interesting here is that we're not thinking our way into a new way of acting; we're acting our way into a new way of thinking.
philanthropy is reorganizing itself before our very eyes.
and even though all of the experiments and all of the big givers don't yet fulfill this aspiration, i think this is the new zeitgeist: open, big, fast, connected, and, let us also hope, long.
we have got to realize that it is going to take a long time to do these things.
if we don't develop the stamina to stick with things -- whatever it is you pick, stick with it -- all of this stuff is just going to be, you know, a fad.
but i'm really hopeful.
and i'm hopeful because it's not only philanthropy that's reorganizing itself, it's also whole other portions of the social sector, and of business, that are busy challenging "business as usual."
and everywhere i go, including here at ted, i feel that there is a new moral hunger that is growing.
what we're seeing is people really wrestling to describe what is this new thing that's happening.
words like "philanthrocapitalism," and "natural capitalism," and "philanthroentrepreneur," and "venture philanthropy."
we don't have a language for it yet.
whatever we call it, it's new, it's beginning, and i think it's gong to quite significant.
and that's where my imagined future comes in, which i am going to call the social singularity.
many of you will realize that i'm ripping a bit off of the science fiction writer vernor vinge's notion of a technological singularity, where a number of trends accelerate and converge and come together to create, really, a shockingly new reality.
it may be that the social singularity ahead is the one that we fear the most: a convergence of catastrophes, of environmental degradation, of weapons of mass destruction, of pandemics, of poverty.
that's because our ability to confront the problems that we face has not kept pace with our ability to create them.
and as we've heard here, it is no exaggeration to say that we hold the future of our civilization in our hands as never before.
the question is, is there a positive social singularity?
is there a frontier for us of how we live together?
our future doesn't have to be imagined.
we can create a future where hope and history rhyme.
but we have a problem.
our experience to date, both individually and collectively, hasn't prepared us for what we're going to need to do, or who we're going to need to be.
we are going to need a new generation of citizen leaders willing to commit ourselves to growing and changing and learning as rapidly as possible.
that's why i have one last thing i want to show you.
this is a photograph taken about 100 years ago of my grandfather and great-grandfather.
this is a newspaper publisher and a banker.
and they were great community leaders.
and, yes, they were great philanthropists.
i keep this photograph close by to me -- it's in my office -- because i've always felt a mystical connection to these two men, both of whom i never knew.
and so, in their honor, i want to offer you this blank slide.
and i want you to imagine that this a photograph of you.
and i want you to think about the community that you want to be part of creating.
whatever that means to you.
and i want you to imagine that it's 100 years from now, and your grandchild, or great-grandchild, or niece or nephew or god-child, is looking at this photograph of you.
what is the story you most want for them to tell?
thank you very much.
katherine fulton: you are the future of philanthropy
in this uplifting talk, katherine fulton sketches the new future of philanthropy -- one where collaboration and innovation allow regular people to do big things, even when money is scarce. giving five practical examples of crowd-driven philanthropy, she calls for a new generation of citizen leaders.
i believe that there are new, hidden tensions that are actually happening between people and institutions -- institutions that are the institutions that people inhabit in their daily life: schools, hospitals, workplaces, factories, offices, etc.
and something that i see happening is something that i would like to call a sort of "democratization of intimacy."
and what do i mean by that?
i mean that what people are doing is, in fact, they are sort of, with their communication channels, they are breaking an imposed isolation that these institutions are imposing on them.
how are they doing this? they're doing it in a very simple way, by calling their mom from work, by iming from their office to their friends, by texting under the desk.
the pictures that you're seeing behind me are people that i visited in the last few months.
and i asked them to come along with the person they communicate with most.
and somebody brought a boyfriend, somebody a father.
one young woman brought her grandfather.
for 20 years, i've been looking at how people use channels such as email, the mobile phone, texting, etc.
what we're actually going to see is that, fundamentally, people are communicating on a regular basis with five, six, seven of their most intimate sphere.
now, lets take some data. facebook.
recently some sociologists from facebook -- facebook is the channel that you would expect is the most enlargening of all channels.
and an average user, said cameron marlow, from facebook, has about 120 friends.
but he actually talks to, has two-way exchanges with, about four to six people on a regular base, depending on his gender.
academic research on instant messaging also shows 100 people on buddy lists, but fundamentally people chat with two, three, four -- anyway, less than five.
my own research on cellphones and voice calls shows that 80 percent of the calls are actually made to four people. 80 percent.
and when you go to skype, it's down to two people.
a lot of sociologists actually are quite disappointed.
i mean, i've been a bit disappointed sometimes when i saw this data and all this deployment, just for five people.
and some sociologists actually feel that it's a closure, it's a cocooning, that we're disengaging from the public.
and i would actually, i would like to show you that if we actually look at who is doing it, and from where they're doing it, actually there is an incredible social transformation.
there are three stories that i think are quite good examples.
the first gentleman, he's a baker.
and so he starts working every morning at four o'clock in the morning.
and around eight o'clock he sort of sneaks away from his oven, cleans his hands from the flour and calls his wife.
he just wants to wish her a good day, because that's the start of her day.
and i've heard this story a number of times.
a young factory worker who works night shifts, who manages to sneak away from the factory floor, where there is cctv by the way, and find a corner, where at 11 o'clock at night he can call his girlfriend and just say goodnight.
or a mother who, at four o'clock, suddenly manages to find a corner in the toilet to check that her children are safely home.
then there is another couple, there is a brazilian couple.
they've lived in italy for a number of years.
they skype with their families a few times a week.
but once a fortnight, they actually put the computer on their dining table, pull out the webcam and actually have dinner with their family in sao paulo. and they have a big event of it.
and i heard this story the first time a couple of years ago from a very modest family of immigrants from kosovo in switzerland.
they had set up a big screen in their living room, and every morning they had breakfast with their grandmother.
but danny miller, who is a very good anthropologist who is working on filipina migrant women who leave their children back in the philippines, was telling me about how much parenting is going on through skype, and how much these mothers are engaged with their children through skype.
and then there is the third couple. they are two friends.
they chat to each other every day, a few times a day actually.
and finally, finally, they've managed to put instant messaging on their computers at work.
and now, obviously, they have it open.
whenever they have a moment they chat to each other.
and this is exactly what we've been seeing with teenagers and kids doing it in school, under the table, and texting under the table to their friends.
so, none of these cases are unique.
i mean, i could tell you hundreds of them.
but what is really exceptional is the setting.
so, think of the three settings i've talked to you about: factory, migration, office.
but it could be in a school, it could be an administration, it could be a hospital.
three settings that, if we just step back 15 years, if you just think back 15 years, when you clocked in, when you clocked in to an office, when you clocked in to a factory, there was no contact for the whole duration of the time, there was no contact with your private sphere.
if you were lucky there was a public phone hanging in the corridor or somewhere.
if you were in management, oh, that was a different story.
maybe you had a direct line.
if you were not, you maybe had to go through an operator.
but basically, when you walked into those buildings, the private sphere was left behind you.
and this has become such a norm of our professional lives, such a norm and such an expectation.
and it had nothing to do with technical capability.
the phones were there. but the expectation was once you moved in there your commitment was fully to the task at hand, fully to the people around you.
that was where the focus had to be.
and this has become such a cultural norm that we actually school our children for them to be capable to do this cleavage.
if you think nursery, kindergarten, first years of school are just dedicated to take away the children, to make them used to staying long hours away from their family.
and then the school enacts perfectly well.
it mimics perfectly all the rituals that we will find in offices: rituals of entry, rituals of exit, the schedules, the uniforms in this country, things that identify you, team-building activities, team building that will allow you to basically be with a random group of kids, or a random group of people that you will have to be with for a number of time.
and of course, the major thing: learn to pay attention, to concentrate and focus your attention.
it only started with the birth of modern bureaucracy, and of industrial revolution.
when people basically had to go somewhere else to work and carry out the work.
and when with modern bureaucracy there was a very rational approach, where there was a clear distinction between the private sphere and the public sphere.
so, until then, basically people were living on top of their trades.
they were living on top of the land they were laboring.
they were living on top of the workshops where they were working.
and if you think, it's permeated our whole culture, even our cities.
if you think of medieval cities, medieval cities the boroughs all have the names of the guilds and professions that lived there.
now we have sprawling residential suburbias that are well distinct from production areas and commercial areas.
and actually, over these 150 years, there has been a very clear class system that also has emerged.
so the lower the status of the job and of the person carrying out, the more removed he would be from his personal sphere.
people have taken this amazing possibility of actually being in contact all through the day or in all types of situations.
and they are doing it massively.
the pew institute, which produces good data on a regular basis on, for instance, in the states, says that -- and i think that this number is conservative -- 50 percent of anybody with email access at work is actually doing private email from his office.
i really think that the number is conservative.
in my own research, we saw that the peak for private email is actually 11 o'clock in the morning, whatever the country.
75 percent of people admit doing private conversations from work on their mobile phones.
100 percent are using text.
the point is that this re-appropriation of the personal sphere is not terribly successful with all institutions.
i'm always surprised the u.s. army sociologists are discussing of the impact for instance, of soldiers in iraq having daily contact with their families.
but there are many institutions that are actually blocking this access.
and every day, every single day, i read news that makes me cringe, like a $15 fine to kids in texas, for using, every time they take out their mobile phone in school.
immediate dismissal to bus drivers in new york, if seen with a mobile phone in a hand.
companies blocking access to im or to facebook.
behind issues of security and safety, which have always been the arguments for social control, in fact what is going on is that these institutions are trying to decide who, in fact, has a right to self determine their attention, to decide, whether they should, or not, be isolated.
and they are actually trying to block, in a certain sense, this movement of a greater possibility of intimacy.
stefana broadbent: how the internet enables intimacy
we worry that im, texting, facebook are spoiling human intimacy, but stefana broadbent's research shows how communication tech is capable of cultivating deeper relationships, bringing love across barriers like distance and workplace rules.
so, how many of you have ever gotten behind the wheel of a car when you really shouldn't have been driving?
maybe you're out on the road for a long day, and you just wanted to get home.
you were tired, but you felt you could drive a few more miles.
maybe you thought, i've had less to drink than everybody else, i should be the one to go home.
or maybe your mind was just entirely elsewhere.
does this sound familiar to you?
now, in those situations, wouldn't it be great if there was a button on your dashboard that you could push, and the car would get you home safely?
now, that's been the promise of the self-driving car, the autonomous vehicle, and it's been the dream since at least 1939, when general motors showcased this idea at their futurama booth at the world's fair.
now, it's been one of those dreams that's always seemed about 20 years in the future.
now, two weeks ago, that dream took a step forward, when the state of nevada granted google's self-driving car the very first license for an autonomous vehicle, clearly establishing that it's legal for them to test it on the roads in nevada.
now, california's considering similar legislation, and this would make sure that the autonomous car is not one of those things that has to stay in vegas.
now, in my lab at stanford, we've been working on autonomous cars too, but with a slightly different spin on things. you see, we've been developing robotic race cars, cars that can actually push themselves to the very limits of physical performance.
now, why would we want to do such a thing?
well, there's two really good reasons for this.
first, we believe that before people turn over control to an autonomous car, that autonomous car should be at least as good as the very best human drivers.
now, if you're like me, and the other 70 percent of the population who know that we are above-average drivers, you understand that's a very high bar.
there's another reason as well.
just like race car drivers can use all of the friction between the tire and the road, all of the car's capabilities to go as fast as possible, we want to use all of those capabilities to avoid any accident we can.
now, you may push the car to the limits not because you're driving too fast, but because you've hit an icy patch of road, conditions have changed.
in those situations, we want a car that is capable enough to avoid any accident that can physically be avoided.
i must confess, there's kind of a third motivation as well.
you see, i have a passion for racing.
in the past, i've been a race car owner, a crew chief and a driving coach, although maybe not at the level that you're currently expecting.
one of the things that we've developed in the lab -- we've developed several vehicles -- is what we believe is the world's first autonomously drifting car.
it's another one of those categories where maybe there's not a lot of competition.
but this is p1. it's an entirely student-built electric vehicle, which through using its rear-wheel drive and front-wheel steer-by-wire can drift around corners.
it can get sideways like a rally car driver, always able to take the tightest curve, even on slippery, changing surfaces, never spinning out.
we've also worked with volkswagen oracle, on shelley, an autonomous race car that has raced at 150 miles an hour through the bonneville salt flats, gone around thunderhill raceway park in the sun, the wind and the rain, and navigated the 153 turns and 12.4 miles of the pikes peak hill climb route in colorado with nobody at the wheel.
i guess it goes without saying that we've had a lot of fun doing this.
but in fact, there's something else that we've developed in the process of developing these autonomous cars.
we have developed a tremendous appreciation for the capabilities of human race car drivers.
as we've looked at the question of how well do these cars perform, we wanted to compare them to our human counterparts.
and we discovered their human counterparts are amazing.
now, we can take a map of a race track, we can take a mathematical model of a car, and with some iteration, we can actually find the fastest way around that track.
we line that up with data that we record from a professional driver, and the resemblance is absolutely remarkable.
yes, there are subtle differences here, but the human race car driver is able to go out and drive an amazingly fast line, without the benefit of an algorithm that compares the trade-off between going as fast as possible in this corner, and shaving a little bit of time off of the straight over here.
not only that, they're able to do it lap after lap after lap.
they're able to go out and consistently do this, pushing the car to the limits every single time.
it's extraordinary to watch.
you put them in a new car, and after a few laps, they've found the fastest line in that car, and they're off to the races.
it really makes you think, we'd love to know what's going on inside their brain.
so as researchers, that's what we decided to find out.
we decided to instrument not only the car, but also the race car driver, to try to get a glimpse into what was going on in their head as they were doing this.
now, this is dr. lene harbott applying electrodes to the head of john morton.
john morton is a former can-am and imsa driver, who's also a class champion at le mans.
fantastic driver, and very willing to put up with graduate students and this sort of research.
she's putting electrodes on his head so that we can monitor the electrical activity in john's brain as he races around the track.
now, clearly we're not going to put a couple of electrodes on his head and understand exactly what all of his thoughts are on the track.
however, neuroscientists have identified certain patterns that let us tease out some very important aspects of this.
for instance, the resting brain tends to generate a lot of alpha waves.
in contrast, theta waves are associated with a lot of cognitive activity, like visual processing, things where the driver is thinking quite a bit.
now, we can measure this, and we can look at the relative power between the theta waves and the alpha waves.
this gives us a measure of mental workload, how much the driver is actually challenged cognitively at any point along the track.
now, we wanted to see if we could actually record this on the track, so we headed down south to laguna seca.
laguna seca is a legendary raceway about halfway between salinas and monterey.
it has a curve there called the corkscrew.
now, the corkscrew is a chicane, followed by a quick right-handed turn as the road drops three stories.
now, the strategy for driving this as explained to me was, you aim for the bush in the distance, and as the road falls away, you realize it was actually the top of a tree.
all right, so thanks to the revs program at stanford, we were able to take john there and put him behind the wheel of a 1960 porsche abarth carrera.
life is way too short for boring cars.
so, here you see john on the track, he's going up the hill -- oh! somebody liked that -- and you can see, actually, his mental workload -- measuring here in the red bar -- you can see his actions as he approaches.
now watch, he has to downshift.
and then he has to turn left.
look for the tree, and down.
not surprisingly, you can see this is a pretty challenging task.
you can see his mental workload spike as he goes through this, as you would expect with something that requires this level of complexity.
but what's really interesting is to look at areas of the track where his mental workload doesn't increase.
i'm going to take you around now to the other side of the track.
turn three. and john's going to go into that corner and the rear end of the car is going to begin to slide out.
he's going to have to correct for that with steering.
so watch as john does this here.
watch the mental workload, and watch the steering.
the car begins to slide out, dramatic maneuver to correct it, and no change whatsoever in the mental workload.
not a challenging task.
in fact, entirely reflexive.
now, our data processing on this is still preliminary, but it really seems that these phenomenal feats that the race car drivers are performing are instinctive.
they are things that they have simply learned to do.
it requires very little mental workload for them to perform these amazing feats.
and their actions are fantastic.
this is exactly what you want to do on the steering wheel to catch the car in this situation.
now, this has given us tremendous insight and inspiration for our own autonomous vehicles.
we've started to ask the question: can we make them a little less algorithmic and a little more intuitive?
can we take this reflexive action that we see from the very best race car drivers, introduce it to our cars, and maybe even into a system that could get onto your car in the future?
that would take us a long step along the road to autonomous vehicles that drive as well as the best humans.
but it's made us think a little bit more deeply as well.
do we want something more from our car than to simply be a chauffeur?
do we want our car to perhaps be a partner, a coach, someone that can use their understanding of the situation to help us reach our potential?
can, in fact, the technology not simply replace humans, but allow us to reach the level of reflex and intuition that we're all capable of?
so, as we move forward into this technological future, i want you to just pause and think of that for a moment.
what is the ideal balance of human and machine?
and as we think about that, let's take inspiration from the absolutely amazing capabilities of the human body and the human mind.
chris gerdes: the future race car -- 150mph, and no driver
autonomous cars are coming -- and they're going to drive better than you. chris gerdes reveals how he and his team are developing robotic race cars that can drive at 150 mph while avoiding every possible accident. and yet, in studying the brainwaves of professional racing drivers, gerdes says he has gained a new appreciation for the instincts of professional drivers. &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
so today, i'm going to tell you about some people who didn't move out of their neighborhoods.
the first one is happening right here in chicago.
brenda palms-farber was hired to help ex-convicts reenter society and keep them from going back into prison.
currently, taxpayers spend about 60,000 dollars per year sending a person to jail.
we know that two-thirds of them are going to go back.
i find it interesting that, for every one dollar we spend, however, on early childhood education, like head start, we save 17 dollars on stuff like incarceration in the future.
or -- think about it -- that 60,000 dollars is more than what it costs to send one person to harvard as well.
but brenda, not being phased by stuff like that, took a look at her challenge and came up with a not-so-obvious solution: create a business that produces skin care products from honey.
okay, it might be obvious to some of you; it wasn't to me.
it's the basis of growing a form of social innovation that has real potential.
she hired seemingly unemployable men and women to care for the bees, harvest the honey and make value-added products that they marketed themselves, and that were later sold at whole foods.
she combined employment experience and training with life skills they needed, like anger-management and teamwork, and also how to talk to future employers about how their experiences actually demonstrated the lessons that they had learned and their eagerness to learn more.
less than four percent of the folks that went through her program actually go back to jail.
so these young men and women learned job-readiness and life skills through bee keeping and became productive citizens in the process.
talk about a sweet beginning.
now, i'm going to take you to los angeles, and lots of people know that l.a. has its issues.
but i'm going to talk about l.a.'s water issues right now.
they have not enough water on most days and too much to handle when it rains.
currently, 20 percent of california's energy consumption is used to pump water into mostly southern california.
their spending loads, loads, to channel that rainwater out into the ocean when it rains and floods as well.
now andy lipkis is working to help l.a. cut infrastructure costs associated with water management and urban heat island -- linking trees, people and technology to create a more livable city.
all that green stuff actually naturally absorbs storm water, also helps cool our cities.
because, come to think about it, do you really want air-conditioning, or is it a cooler room that you want?
how you get it shouldn't make that much of a difference.
so a few years ago, l.a. county decided that they needed to spend 2.5 billion dollars to repair the city schools.
and andy and his team discovered that they were going to spend 200 million of those dollars on asphalt to surround the schools themselves.
and by presenting a really strong economic case, they convinced the l.a. government that replacing that asphalt with trees and other greenery, that the schools themselves would save the system more on energy than they spend on horticultural infrastructure.
so ultimately, 20 million square feet of asphalt was replaced or avoided, and electrical consumption for air-conditioning went down, while employment for people to maintain those grounds went up, resulting in a net-savings to the system, but also healthier students and schools system employees as well.
now judy bonds is a coal miner's daughter.
her family has eight generations in a town called whitesville, west virginia.
and if anyone should be clinging to the former glory of the coal mining history, and of the town, it should be judy.
but the way coal is mined right now is different from the deep mines that her father and her father's father would go down into and that employed essentially thousands and thousands of people.
now, two dozen men can tear down a mountain in several months, and only for about a few years' worth of coal.
that kind of technology is called "mountaintop removal."
it can make a mountain go from this to this in a few short months.
just imagine that the air surrounding these places -- it's filled with the residue of explosives and coal.
when we visited, it gave some of the people we were with this strange little cough after being only there for just a few hours or so -- not just miners, but everybody.
and judy saw her landscape being destroyed and her water poisoned.
and the coal companies just move on after the mountain was emptied, leaving even more unemployment in their wake.
but she also saw the difference in potential wind energy on an intact mountain, and one that was reduced in elevation by over 2,000 feet.
three years of dirty energy with not many jobs, or centuries of clean energy with the potential for developing expertise and improvements in efficiency based on technical skills, and developing local knowledge about how to get the most out of that region's wind.
she calculated the up-front cost and the payback over time, and it's a net-plus on so many levels for the local, national and global economy.
it's a longer payback than mountaintop removal, but the wind energy actually pays back forever.
now mountaintop removal pays very little money to the locals, and it gives them a lot of misery.
the water is turned into goo.
most people are still unemployed, leading to most of the same kinds of social problems that unemployed people in inner cities also experience -- drug and alcohol abuse, domestic abuse, teen pregnancy and poor heath, as well.
now judy and i -- i have to say -- totally related to each other.
not quite an obvious alliance.
i mean, literally, her hometown is called whitesville, west virginia.
i mean, they are not -- they ain't competing for the birthplace of hip hop title or anything like that.
but the back of my t-shirt, the one that she gave me, says, "save the endangered hillbillies."
so homegirls and hillbillies we got it together and totally understand that this is what it's all about.
but just a few months ago, judy was diagnosed with stage-three lung cancer.
and it has since moved to her bones and her brain.
and i just find it so bizarre that she's suffering from the same thing that she tried so hard to protect people from.
but her dream of coal river mountain wind is her legacy.
and she might not get to see that mountaintop.
but rather than writing yet some kind of manifesto or something, she's leaving behind a business plan to make it happen.
that's what my homegirl is doing.
so i'm so proud of that.
but these three people don't know each other, but they do have an awful lot in common.
they're all problem solvers, and they're just some of the many examples that i really am privileged to see, meet and learn from in the examples of the work that i do now.
i was really lucky to have them all featured on my corporation for public radio radio show called thepromisedland.org.
now they're all very practical visionaries.
they take a look at the demands that are out there -- beauty products, healthy schools, electricity -- and how the money's flowing to meet those demands.
and when the cheapest solutions involve reducing the number of jobs, you're left with unemployed people, and those people aren't cheap.
in fact, they make up some of what i call the most expensive citizens, and they include generationally impoverished, traumatized vets returning from the middle east, people coming out of jail.
and for the veterans in particular, the v.a. said there's a six-fold increase in mental health pharmaceuticals by vets since 2003.
i think that number's probably going to go up.
they're not the largest number of people, but they are some of the most expensive -- and in terms of the likelihood for domestic abuse, drug and alcohol abuse, poor performance by their kids in schools and also poor health as a result of stress.
so these three guys all understand how to productively channel dollars through our local economies to meet existing market demands, reduce the social problems that we have now and prevent new problems in the future.
and there are plenty of other examples like that.
one problem: waste handling and unemployment.
even when we think or talk about recycling, lots of recyclable stuff ends up getting incinerated or in landfills and leaving many municipalities, diversion rates -- they leave much to be recycled.
and where is this waste handled? usually in poor communities.
and we know that eco-industrial business, these kinds of business models -- there's a model in europe called the eco-industrial park, where either the waste of one company is the raw material for another, or you use recycled materials to make goods that you can actually use and sell.
we can create these local markets and incentives for recycled materials to be used as raw materials for manufacturing.
and in my hometown, we actually tried to do one of these in the bronx, but our mayor decided what he wanted to see was a jail on that same spot.
fortunately -- because we wanted to create hundreds of jobs -- but after many years, the city wanted to build a jail.
they've since abandoned that project, thank goodness.
another problem: unhealthy food systems and unemployment.
working-class and poor urban americans are not benefiting economically from our current food system.
it relies too much on transportation, chemical fertilization, big use of water and also refrigeration.
mega agricultural operations often are responsible for poisoning our waterways and our land, and it produces this incredibly unhealthy product that costs us billions in healthcare and lost productivity.
and so we know "urban ag" is a big buzz topic this time of the year, but it's mostly gardening, which has some value in community building -- lots of it -- but it's not in terms of creating jobs or for food production.
the numbers just aren't there.
part of my work now is really laying the groundwork to integrate urban ag and rural food systems to hasten the demise of the 3,000-mile salad by creating a national brand of urban-grown produce in every city, that uses regional growing power and augments it with indoor growing facilities, owned and operated by small growers, where now there are only consumers.
this can support seasonal farmers around metro areas who are losing out because they really can't meet the year-round demand for produce.
it's not a competition with rural farm; it's actually reinforcements.
it allies in a really positive and economically viable food system.
the goal is to meet the cities' institutional demands for hospitals, senior centers, schools, daycare centers, and produce a network of regional jobs, as well.
this is smart infrastructure.
and how we manage our built environment affects the health and well-being of people every single day.
our municipalities, rural and urban, play the operational course of infrastructure -- things like waste disposal, energy demand, as well as social costs of unemployment, drop-out rates, incarceration rates and the impacts of various public health costs.
smart infrastructure can provide cost-saving ways for municipalities to handle both infrastructure and social needs.
and we want to shift the systems that open the doors for people who were formerly tax burdens to become part of the tax base.
and imagine a national business model that creates local jobs and smart infrastructure to improve local economic stability.
so i'm hoping you can see a little theme here.
these examples indicate a trend.
i haven't created it, and it's not happening by accident.
i'm noticing that it's happening all over the country, and the good news is that it's growing.
and we all need to be invested in it.
it is an essential pillar to this country's recovery.
and i call it "hometown security."
the recession has us reeling and fearful, and there's something in the air these days that is also very empowering.
it's a realization that we are the key to our own recovery.
now is the time for us to act in our own communities where we think local and we act local.
and when we do that, our neighbors -- be they next-door, or in the next state, or in the next country -- will be just fine.
the sum of the local is the global.
hometown security means rebuilding our natural defenses, putting people to work, restoring our natural systems.
hometown security means creating wealth here at home, instead of destroying it overseas.
tackling social and environmental problems at the same time with the same solution yields great cost savings, wealth generation and national security.
many great and inspiring solutions have been generated across america.
the challenge for us now is to identify and support countless more.
now, hometown security is about taking care of your own, but it's not like the old saying, "charity begins at home."
i recently read a book called "love leadership" by john hope bryant.
and it's about leading in a world that really does seem to be operating on the basis of fear.
and reading that book made me reexamine that theory because i need to explain what i mean by that.
see, my dad was a great, great man in many ways.
he grew up in the segregated south, escaped lynching and all that during some really hard times, and he provided a really stable home for me and my siblings and a whole bunch of other people that fell on hard times.
but, like all of us, he had some problems.
and his was gambling, compulsively.
to him that phrase, "charity begins at home," meant that my payday -- or someone else's -- would just happen to coincide with his lucky day.
and sometimes i would loan him money from my after-school or summer jobs, and he always had the great intention of paying me back with interest, of course, after he hit it big.
and he did sometimes, believe it or not, at a racetrack in los angeles -- one reason to love l.a. -- back in the 1940s.
he made 15,000 dollars cash and bought the house that i grew up in.
so i'm not that unhappy about that.
but listen, i did feel obligated to him, and i grew up -- then i grew up.
and i'm a grown woman now, and i have learned a few things along the way.
to me, charity often is just about giving, because you're supposed to, or because it's what you've always done, or it's about giving until it hurts.
i'm about providing the means to build something that will grow and intensify its original investment and not just require greater giving next year -- i'm not trying to feed the habit.
i spent some years watching how good intentions for community empowerment, that were supposed to be there to support the community and empower it, actually left people in the same, if not worse, position that they were in before.
and over the past 20 years, we've spent record amounts of philanthropic dollars on social problems, yet educational outcomes, malnutrition, incarceration, obesity, diabetes, income disparity, they've all gone up with some exceptions -- in particular, infant mortality among people in poverty -- but it's a great world that we're bringing them into as well.
and i know a little bit about these issues, because, for many years, i spent a long time in the non-profit industrial complex, and i'm a recovering executive director, two years clean.
but during that time, i realized that it was about projects and developing them on the local level that really was going to do the right thing for our communities.
but i really did struggle for financial support.
the greater our success, the less money came in from foundations.
and i tell you, being on the ted stage and winning a macarthur in the same exact year gave everyone the impression that i had arrived.
and by the time i'd moved on, i was actually covering a third of my agency's budget deficit with speaking fees.
and i think because early on, frankly, my programs were just a little bit ahead of their time.
but since then, the park that was just a dump and was featured at a ted2006 talk became this little thing.
but i did in fact get married in it.
over here.
there goes my dog who led me to the park in my wedding.
the south bronx greenway was also just a drawing on the stage back in 2006.
since then, we got about 50 million dollars in stimulus package money to come and get here.
and we love this, because i love construction now, because we're watching these things actually happen.
so i want everyone to understand the critical importance of shifting charity into enterprise.
i started my firm to help communities across the country realize their own potential to improve everything about the quality of life for their people.
hometown security is next on my to-do list.
what we need are people who see the value in investing in these types of local enterprises, who will partner with folks like me to identify the growth trends and climate adaptation as well as understand the growing social costs of business as usual.
we need to work together to embrace and repair our land, repair our power systems and repair ourselves.
it's time to stop building the shopping malls, the prisons, the stadiums and other tributes to all of our collective failures.
it is time that we start building living monuments to hope and possibility.
thank you very much.
majora carter: 3 stories of local eco-entrepreneurship
the future of green is local -- and entrepreneurial. in her talk, majora carter brings us the stories of three people who are saving their own communities while saving the planet. call it "hometown security." &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
most people don't know that when i went to high school in this country -- i applied for university at a time when i was convinced i was going to be an artist and be a sculptor.
and i came from a very privileged background. i was very lucky.
my family was wealthy, and my father believed in one thing, and that was to give us all as much education as we wanted.
and i announced i wanted to be a sculptor in paris.
and he was a clever man. he sort of said, "well, that's ok, but you've done very well in your math sats."
in fact, i'd got an 800. and he thought i did very well -- and i did, too -- in the arts: this was my passion.
and he said "if you go to mit," to which i had been given early admission, "i will pay for every year you're at mit, in graduate or undergraduate -- as much as you want -- i will pay for an equal number of years for you to live in paris."
and i thought that was the best deal in town, so i accepted it immediately.
and i decided that if i was good in art, and i was good in mathematics, i'd study architecture, which was the blending of the two.
i went and told my headmaster that, at prep school.
and i said to him what i was doing, that i was going to go study architecture because it was art and mathematics put together.
he said to me something that just went completely over my head.
he said, "you know, i like grey suits, and i like pin-striped suits, but i don't like grey pin-striped suits."
and i thought, "what a turkey this guy is," and i went off to mit.
i studied architecture, then did a second degree in architecture, and then actually quickly realized that it wasn't architecture.
that really, the mixing of art and science was computers, and that that really was the place to bring both, and enjoyed a career doing that.
and probably, if i were to fill out jim citrin's scale, i'd put 100 percent on the side of the equation where you spend time making it possible for others to be creative.
and after doing this for a long time, and the media lab passing the baton on, i thought, "well, maybe it's time for me to do a project.
something that would be important, but also something that would take advantage of all of these privileges that one had."
and in the case of the media lab, knowing a lot of people, knowing people who were either executives or wealthy, and also not having, in my own case, a career to worry about anymore.
my career, i mean, i'd done my career.
didn't have to worry about earning money.
didn't have to worry about what people thought about me.
and i said, "boy, let's really do something that takes advantage of all these features," and thought that if we could address education, by leveraging the children, and bringing to the world the access of the computers, that that was really the thing we should do.
never shown this picture before, and probably going to be sued for it.
it's taken at three o'clock in the morning, without the permission of the company.
it's about two weeks old. there they are, folks.
if you look at the picture, you'll see they're stacked up.
those are conveyor belts that go around.
this is one of the conveyor belts with the thing going by, but then you'll see the ones up above.
what happens is, they burn into flash memory the software, and then test them for a few hours.
but you've got to have the thing moving on the assembly line, because it's constant.
so they go around in this loop, which is why you see them up there.
so this was great for us because it was a real turning point. but it goes back.
this picture was taken in 1982, just before the ibm pc was even announced.
seymour papert and i were bringing computers to schools and developing nations at a time when it was way ahead of itself.
but one thing we learned was that these kids can absolutely jump into it just the same way as our kids do here.
and when people tell me, "who's going to teach the teachers to teach the kids?"
i say to myself, "what planet do you come from?"
okay, there's not a person in this room -- i don't care how techie you are -- there's not a person in this room that doesn't give their laptop or cell phone to a kid to help them debug it. ok?
we all need help, even those of us who are very seasoned.
this picture of seymour -- 25 years ago. seymour made a very simple observation in 1968, and then basically presented it in 1970 -- april 11 to be precise -- called "teaching children thinking."
what he observed was that kids who write computer programs understand things differently, and when they debug the programs, they come the closest to learning about learning.
that was very important, and in some sense, we've lost that.
kids don't program enough and boy, if there's anything i hope this brings back, it's programming to kids.
it's really important. using applications is ok, but programming is absolutely fundamental.
this is being launched with three languages in it: squeak, logo, and a third, that i've never even seen before.
the point being, this is going to be very, very intensive on the programming side.
this photograph is very important because it's much later.
this is in the early 2000s. my son, dimitri -- who's here, many of you know dimitri -- went to cambodia, set up this school that we had built, just as the school connected it to the internet.
and these kids had their laptops. but it was really what spirited this, plus the influence of joe and others. we started one laptop per child.
this is the same village in cambodia, just a couple of months ago.
these kids are real pros. there were just 7,000 machines out there being tested by kids. being a nonprofit is absolutely fundamental.
everybody advised me not to be a nonprofit, but they were all wrong.
and the reason being a nonprofit is important is actually twofold.
there are many reasons, but the two that merit the little bit of time is: one, the clarity of purpose is there. the moral purpose is clear.
i can see any head of state, any executive i want, at any time, because i'm not selling laptops. ok? i have no shareholders.
whether we sell, it doesn't make any difference whatsoever.
the clarity of purpose is absolutely critical. and the second is very counterintuitive -- you can get the best people in the world.
if you look at our professional services, including search firms, including communications, including legal services, including banking, they're all pro bono. and it's not to save money.
we've got money in the bank. it's because you get the best people.
you get the people who are doing it because they believe in the mission, and they're the best people.
we couldn't afford to hire a cfo. we put out a job description for a cfo at zero salary, and we had a queue of people.
it allows you to team up with people. the u.n.'s not going to be our partner if we're profit making. so announcing this with kofi annan was very important, and the u.n. allowed us to basically reach all the countries. and this was the machine we were showing before i met yves behar.
and while this machine in some sense is silly, in retrospect, it actually served a very important purpose.
that pencil-yellow crank was remembered by everybody.
everybody remembered the pencil-yellow crank. it's different.
it was getting its power in a different way. it's kind of childlike.
even though this wasn't the direction we went because the crank -- it really is stupid to have it on board, by the way.
in spite of what some people in the press don't get it, didn't understand it, we didn't take it off because we didn't want to do -- having it on the laptop itself is really not what you want.
you want a separate thing, like the ac adaptor.
i didn't bring one with me, but they really work much better off-board.
and then, i could tell you lots about the laptop, but i decided on just four things.
just keep in mind -- because there are other people, including bill gates, who said, "gee, you've got a real computer."
that computer is unlike anything you've had, and does things -- there are four of them -- that you don't come close to. and it's very important to be low power, and i hope that's picked up more by the industry.
that the reason that you want to be below two watts is that's roughly what you can generate with your upper body.
dual-mode display -- that sunlight display's fantastic.
we were using it at lunch today in the sunlight, and the more sunlight the better.
and that was really critical. the mesh network, it'll become commonplace.
and of course, "rugged" goes without saying.
and the reason i think design matters isn't because i wanted to go to art school.
and by the way, when i graduated from mit, i thought the worst and silliest thing to do would be to go to paris for six years.
so, i didn't do that. but design matters for a number of reasons.
the most important being that it is the best way to make an inexpensive product.
most people make inexpensive products by taking cheap design, cheap labor, cheap components, and making a cheap laptop.
and, in english, the word "cheap" has a double meaning, which is really appropriate, because it's cheap, in the pejorative sense, as well as inexpensive.
but if you take a different approach, and you think of very large-scale integration, very advanced materials, very advanced manufacturing -- so you're pouring chemicals in one end, ipods are spewing out the other -- and really cool design, that's what we wanted to do.
and i can race through these and save a lot of time because yves and i obviously didn't compare notes.
these are his slides, and so i don't have to talk about them.
but it was really, to us, very important as a strategy.
it wasn't just to kind of make it cute, because somebody -- you know, good design is very important.
yves showed one of the power-generating devices.
the mesh network, the reason i -- and i won't go into it in great detail -- but when we deliver laptops to kids in the remotest and poorest parts of the world, they're connected. there's not just laptops.
and so, we have to drop in satellite dishes. we put in generators.
it's a lot of stuff that goes behind these. these can talk to each other.
if you're in a desert, they can talk to each other about two kilometers apart.
if you're in the jungle, it's about 500 meters. so if a kid bicycles home, or walks a few miles, they're going to be off the grid, so to speak.
they're not going to be near another laptop, so you have to nail these onto a tree, and sort of, get it.
you don't call verizon or sprint. you build your own network.
and that's very important, the user interface.
we are launching with 18 keyboards. english is by far the minority.
latin is relatively rare, too. you just look at some of the languages.
i'm willing to suspect some of you hadn't even heard of them before.
is there anybody in the room, one person, unless you work with olpc, is there anybody in the room that can tell me what language the keyboard is that's on the screen? there's only one hand -- so you get it.
yes, you're right. he's right. it's amharic, it's ethiopian. in ethiopia, there's never been a keyboard.
there is no keyboard standard because there's no market.
and this is the big difference.
again, when you're a nonprofit, you look at children as a mission, not as a market.
so we went to ethiopia, and we helped them make a keyboard.
and this will become the standard ethiopian keyboard.
so what i want to end with is sort of what we're doing to roll it out.
and we changed strategy completely. i decided at the beginning -- it was a pretty good thing to decide in the beginning, it's not what we're doing now -- is to go to six countries.
big countries, one of them is not so big, but it's rich.
here's the six. we went to the six, and in each case the head of state said he would do it, he'd do a million.
in the case of gaddafi, he'd do 1.2 million, and that they would launch it.
we thought, this is exactly the right strategy, get it out, and then the little countries could sort of piggyback on these big countries.
and so i went to each of those countries at least six times, met with the head of state probably two or three times.
in each case, got the ministers, went through a lot of the stuff.
this was a period in my life where i was traveling 330 days per year.
not something you'd envy or want to do.
in the case of libya, it was a lot of fun meeting gaddafi in his tent.
the camel smells were unbelievable.
and it was 45 degrees c. i mean, this was not what you'd call a cool experience. and former countries -- i say former, because none of them really came through this summer -- there was a big difference between getting a head of state to have a photo opportunity, make a press release.
so we went to smaller ones. uruguay, bless their hearts.
small country, not so rich. president said he'd do it, and guess what?
he did do it. the tender had nothing in it that related to us, nothing specific about sunlight-readable, mesh-network, low-power, but just a vanilla laptop proposal.
and guess what? we won it hands down.
when it was announced that they were going to do every child in uruguay, the first 100,000, boom, went to olpc.
the next day -- the next day, not even 24 hours had passed -- in peru, the president of peru said, "we'll do 250." and boom, a little domino effect.
the president of rwanda stepped in and said he would do it.
the president of ethiopia said he would do it.
and boom, boom, boom. the president of mongolia.
and so what happens is, these things start to happen with these countries -- still not enough.
add up all those countries, it didn't quite get to thing, so we said, "let's start a program in the united states." so, end of august, early september, we decide to do this. we announced it near the middle, end -- just when the clinton initiative was taking place.
we thought that was a good time to announce it.
launched it on the 12 of november.
we said it would be just for a short period until the 26. we've extended it until the 31.
and the "give one, get one" program is really important because it got a lot of people absolutely interested.
the first day it was just wild. and then we said, "well, let's get people to give many. not just one, and get one, but maybe give 100, give 1,000." and that's where you come in.
and that's where i think it's very important. i don't want you all to go out and buy 400 dollars worth of laptops. okay? do it, but that's not going to help. okay?
if everybody in this room goes out tonight and orders one of these things for 400 dollars, whatever it is, 300 people in the room doing it -- yeah, great.
i want you do something else.
and it's not to go out and buy 100 or 1,000, though, i invite you to do that, and 10,000 would be even better.
tell people about it! it's got to become viral, ok?
use your mailing lists. people in this room have extraordinary mailing lists.
get your friends to give one, get one.
and if each one of you sends it to 300 or 400 people, that would be fantastic.
i won't dwell on the pricing at all.
just to say that when you do the "give one, get one," a lot of press is a bit about, "they didn't make it, it's 188 dollars, it's not 100."
it will be 100 in two years. it will go below 100.
we've pledged not to add features, but to bring that price down.
but it was the countries that wanted it to go up, and we let them push it up for all sorts of reasons. so what you can do -- i've just said it. don't just give one, get one.
i just want to end with one last one. this one is not even 24-hours old, or maybe it's 24-hours.
the first kids got their laptops. they got them by ship, and i'm talking now about 7,000, 8,000 at a time went out this week.
they went to uruguay, peru, mexico.
and it's been slow coming, and we're only making about 5,000 a week, but we hope, we hope, sometime in next year, maybe by the middle of the year, to hit a million a month. now put that number, and a million isn't so much. it's not a big number.
we're selling a billion cell phones worldwide this year.
but a million a month in laptop-land is a big number.
and the world production today, everybody combined, making laptops, is five million a month. so i'm standing here telling you that sometime next year, we're going to make 20 percent of the world production.
and if we do that, there are going to be a lot of lucky kids out there.
and we hope if you have eg two years from now, or whenever you have it again, i won't have bad breath, and i will be invited back, and will have, hopefully by then, maybe 100 million out there to children.
nicholas negroponte: one laptop per child, two years on
nicholas negroponte talks about how one laptop per child is doing, two years in. speaking at the eg conference while the first xo laptops roll off the production line, he recaps the controversies and recommits to the goals of this far-reaching project.
i, like many of you, am one of the two billion people on earth who live in cities.
and there are days -- i don't know about the rest of you guys -- but there are days when i palpably feel how much i rely on other people for pretty much everything in my life.
and some days, that can even be a little scary.
but what i'm here to talk to you about today is how that same interdependence is actually an extremely powerful social infrastructure that we can actually harness to help heal some of our deepest civic issues, if we apply open source collaboration.
a couple of years ago, i read an article by new york times writer michael pollan in which he argued that growing even some of our own food is one of the best things that we can do for the environment.
now at the time that i was reading this, it was the middle of the winter and i definitely did not have room for a lot of dirt in my new york city apartment.
so i was basically just willing to settle for just reading the next wired magazine and finding out how the experts were going to figure out how to solve all these problems for us in the future.
but that was actually exactly the point that michael pollan was making in this article -- was it's precisely when we hand over the responsibility for all these things to specialists that we cause the kind of messes that we see with the food system.
so, i happen to know a little bit from my own work about how nasa has been using hydroponics to explore growing food in space.
and you can actually get optimal nutritional yield by running a kind of high-quality liquid soil over plants' root systems.
now to a vegetable plant, my apartment has got to be about as foreign as outer space.
but i can offer some natural light and year-round climate control.
fast-forward two years later: we now have window farms, which are vertical, hydroponic platforms for food-growing indoors.
and the way it works is that there's a pump at the bottom, which periodically sends some of this liquid nutrient solution up to the top, which then trickles down through plants' root systems that are suspended in clay pellets -- so there's no dirt involved.
now light and temperature vary with each window's microclimate, so a window farm requires a farmer, and she must decide what kind of crops she is going to put in her window farm, and whether she is going to feed her food organically.
back at the time, a window farm was no more than a technically complex idea that was going to require a lot of testing.
and i really wanted it to be an open project, because hydroponics is one of the fastest growing areas of patenting in the united states right now and could possibly become another area like monsanto, where we have a lot of corporate intellectual property in the way of people's food.
so i decided that, instead of creating a product, what i was going to do was open this up to a whole bunch of co-developers.
the first few systems that we created, they kind of worked.
we were actually able to grow about a salad a week in a typical new york city apartment window.
and we were able to grow cherry tomatoes and cucumbers, all kinds of stuff.
but the first few systems were these leaky, loud power-guzzlers that martha stewart would definitely never have approved.
so to bring on more co-developers, what we did was we created a social media site on which we published the designs, we explained how they worked, and we even went so far as to point out everything that was wrong with these systems.
and then we invited people all over the world to build them and experiment with us.
so actually now on this website, we have 18,000 people.
and we have window farms all over the world.
what we're doing is what nasa or a large corporation would call r&amp;d, or research and development.
but what we call it is r&amp;d-i-y, or research and develop it yourself.
so for example, jackson came along and suggested that we use air pumps instead of water pumps.
it took building a whole bunch of systems to get it right, but once we did, we were able to cut our carbon footprint nearly in half.
tony in chicago has been taking on growing experiments, like lots of other window farmers, and he's been able to get his strawberries to fruit for nine months of the year in low-light conditions by simply changing out the organic nutrients.
and window farmers in finland have been customizing their window farms for the dark days of the finnish winters by outfitting them with led grow lights that they're now making open source and part of the project.
so window farms have been evolving through a rapid versioning process similar to software.
and with every open source project, the real benefit is the interplay between the specific concerns of people customizing their systems for their own particular concerns and the universal concerns.
so my core team and i are able to concentrate on the improvements that really benefit everyone.
and we're able to look out for the needs of newcomers.
so for do-it-yourselfers, we provide free, very well-tested instructions so that anyone, anywhere around the world, can build one of these systems for free.
and there's a patent pending on these systems as well that's held by the community.
and to fund the project, we partner to create products that we then sell to schools and to individuals who don't have time to build their own systems.
now within our community, a certain culture has appeared.
in our culture, it is better to be a tester who supports someone else's idea than it is to be just the idea guy.
what we get out of this project is we get support for our own work, as well as an experience of actually contributing to the environmental movement in a way other than just screwing in new light bulbs.
but i think that eileen expresses best what we really get out of this, which is the actual joy of collaboration.
so she expresses here what it's like to see someone halfway across the world having taken your idea, built upon it and then acknowledging you for contributing.
if we really want to see the kind of wide consumer behavior change that we're all talking about as environmentalists and food people, maybe we just need to ditch the term "consumer" and get behind the people who are doing stuff.
open source projects tend to have a momentum of their own.
and what we're seeing is that r&amp;d-i-y has moved beyond just window farms and leds into solar panels and aquaponic systems.
and we're building upon innovations of generations who went before us.
and we're looking ahead at generations who really need us to retool our lives now.
so we ask that you join us in rediscovering the value of citizens united, and to declare that we are all still pioneers.
britta riley: a garden in my apartment
britta riley wanted to grow her own food . so she and her friends developed a system for growing plants in discarded plastic bottles -- researching, testing and tweaking the system using social media, trying many variations at once and quickly arriving at the optimal system. call it distributed diy. and the results? delicious. &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
what i want to tell you about today is how i see robots invading our lives at multiple levels, over multiple timescales.
and when i look out in the future, i can't imagine a world, 500 years from now, where we don't have robots everywhere.
assuming -- despite all the dire predictions from many people about our future -- assuming we're still around, i can't imagine the world not being populated with robots.
and then the question is, well, if they're going to be here in 500 years, are they going to be everywhere sooner than that?
are they going to be around in 50 years?
yeah, i think that's pretty likely -- there's going to be lots of robots everywhere.
and in fact i think that's going to be a lot sooner than that.
i think we're sort of on the cusp of robots becoming common, and i think we're sort of around 1978 or 1980 in personal computer years, where the first few robots are starting to appear.
computers sort of came around through games and toys.
and you know, the first computer most people had in the house may have been a computer to play pong, a little microprocessor embedded, and then other games that came after that.
and we're starting to see that same sort of thing with robots: lego mindstorms, furbies -- who here -- did anyone here have a furby?
yeah, there's 38 million of them sold worldwide.
they are pretty common. and they're a little tiny robot, a simple robot with some sensors, a little bit of processing actuation.
on the right there is another robot doll, who you could get a couple of years ago.
and just as in the early days, when there was a lot of sort of amateur interaction over computers, you can now get various hacking kits, how-to-hack books.
and on the left there is a platform from evolution robotics, where you put a pc on, and you program this thing with a gui to wander around your house and do various stuff.
and then there's a higher price point sort of robot toys -- the sony aibo. and on the right there, is one that the nec developed, the papero, which i don't think they're going to release.
but nevertheless, those sorts of things are out there.
and we've seen, over the last two or three years, lawn-mowing robots, husqvarna on the bottom, friendly robotics on top there, an israeli company.
and then in the last 12 months or so we've started to see a bunch of home-cleaning robots appear.
the top left one is a very nice home-cleaning robot from a company called dyson, in the u.k. except it was so expensive -- 3,500 dollars -- they didn't release it.
but at the bottom left, you see electrolux, which is on sale.
another one from karcher.
at the bottom right is one that i built in my lab about 10 years ago, and we finally turned that into a product.
and let me just show you that.
we're going to give this away i think, chris said, after the talk.
this is a robot that you can go out and buy, and that will clean up your floor.
and it starts off sort of just going around in ever-increasing circles.
if it hits something -- you people see that?
now it's doing wall-following, it's following around my feet to clean up around me. let's see, let's -- oh, who stole my rice krispies? they stole my rice krispies!
don't worry, relax, no, relax, it's a robot, it's smart!
see, the three-year-old kids, they don't worry about it.
it's grown-ups that get really upset.
we'll just put some crap here.
i don't know if you see -- so, i put a bunch of rice krispies there, i put some pennies, let's just shoot it at that, see if it cleans up.
yeah, ok. so -- we'll leave that for later.
part of the trick was building a better cleaning mechanism, actually; the intelligence on board was fairly simple.
and that's true with a lot of robots.
we've all, i think, become, sort of computational chauvinists, and think that computation is everything, but the mechanics still matter.
here's another robot, the packbot, that we've been building for a bunch of years.
it's a military surveillance robot, to go in ahead of troops -- looking at caves, for instance.
but we had to make it fairly robust, much more robust than the robots we build in our labs.
on board that robot is a pc running linux.
it can withstand a 400g shock. the robot has local intelligence: it can flip itself over, can get itself into communication range, can go upstairs by itself, et cetera.
okay, so it's doing local navigation there.
a soldier gives it a command to go upstairs, and it does.
that was not a controlled descent.
now it's going to head off.
and the big breakthrough for these robots, really, was september 11th.
we had the robots down at the world trade center late that evening.
couldn't do a lot in the main rubble pile, things were just too -- there was nothing left to do.
but we did go into all the surrounding buildings that had been evacuated, and searched for possible survivors in the buildings that were too dangerous to go into.
let's run this video.
reporter: ...battlefield companions are helping to reduce the combat risks.
nick robertson has that story.
rodney brooks: can we have another one of these?
so, this is a corporal who had seen a robot two weeks previously.
he's sending robots into caves, looking at what's going on.
the robot's being totally autonomous.
the worst thing that's happened in the cave so far was one of the robots fell down ten meters.
so one year ago, the us military didn't have these robots.
now they're on active duty in afghanistan every day.
and that's one of the reasons they say a robot invasion is happening.
there's a sea change happening in how -- where technology's going.
and over the next couple of months, we're going to be sending robots in production down producing oil wells to get that last few years of oil out of the ground.
very hostile environments, 150˚ c, 10,000 psi.
autonomous robots going down, doing this sort of work.
but robots like this, they're a little hard to program.
how, in the future, are we going to program our robots and make them easier to use?
and i want to actually use a robot here -- a robot named chris -- stand up. yeah. okay.
come over here. now notice, he thinks robots have to be a bit stiff.
he sort of does that. but i'm going to -- i'm just british. rb: oh.
i'm going to show this robot a task. it's a very complex task.
now notice, he nodded there, he was giving me some indication he was understanding the flow of communication.
and if i'd said something completely bizarre he would have looked askance at me, and regulated the conversation.
so now i brought this up in front of him.
i'd looked at his eyes, and i saw his eyes looked at this bottle top.
and i'm doing this task here, and he's checking up.
his eyes are going back and forth up to me, to see what i'm looking at -- so we've got shared attention.
and so i do this task, and he looks, and he looks to me to see what's happening next. and now i'll give him the bottle, and we'll see if he can do the task. can you do that?
okay. he's pretty good. yeah. good, good, good.
i didn't show you how to do that.
now see if you can put it back together.
and he thinks a robot has to be really slow.
good robot, that's good.
so we saw a bunch of things there.
we saw when we're interacting, we're trying to show someone how to do something, we direct their visual attention.
the other thing communicates their internal state to us, whether he's understanding or not, regulates a social interaction.
there was shared attention looking at the same sort of thing, and recognizing socially communicated reinforcement at the end.
and we've been trying to put that into our lab robots because we think this is how you're going to want to interact with robots in the future.
i just want to show you one technical diagram here.
the most important thing for building a robot that you can interact with socially is its visual attention system.
because what it pays attention to is what it's seeing and interacting with, and what you're understanding what it's doing.
so in the videos i'm about to show you, you're going to see a visual attention system on a robot which has -- it looks for skin tone in hsv space, so it works across all human colorings.
it looks for highly saturated colors, from toys.
and it looks for things that move around.
and it weights those together into an attention window, and it looks for the highest-scoring place -- the stuff where the most interesting stuff is happening -- and that is what its eyes then segue to.
at the same time, some top-down sort of stuff: might decide that it's lonely and look for skin tone, or might decide that it's bored and look for a toy to play with.
and so these weights change.
and over here on the right, this is what we call the steven spielberg memorial module.
did people see the movie "ai"?
rb: yeah, it was really bad, but -- remember, especially when haley joel osment, the little robot, looked at the blue fairy for 2,000 years without taking his eyes off it?
well, this gets rid of that, because this is a habituation gaussian that gets negative, and more and more intense as it looks at one thing.
and it gets bored, so it will then look away at something else.
so, once you've got that -- and here's a robot, here's kismet, looking around for a toy. you can tell what it's looking at.
you can estimate its gaze direction from those eyeballs covering its camera, and you can tell when it's actually seeing the toy.
and it's got a little bit of an emotional response here.
but it's still going to pay attention if something more significant comes into its field of view -- such as cynthia breazeal, the builder of this robot, from the right.
it sees her, pays attention to her.
kismet has an underlying, three-dimensional emotional space, a vector space, of where it is emotionally.
and at different places in that space, it expresses -- can we have the volume on here?
can you hear that now, out there?
kismet: do you really think so? do you really think so?
do you really think so?
rb: so it's expressing its emotion through its face and the prosody in its voice.
and when i was dealing with my robot over here, chris, the robot, was measuring the prosody in my voice, and so we have the robot measure prosody for four basic messages that mothers give their children pre-linguistically.
here we've got naive subjects praising the robot: voice: nice robot.
you're such a cute little robot.
rb: and the robot's reacting appropriately.
voice: look at my smile.
rb: it smiles. she imitates the smile. this happens a lot.
these are naive subjects.
here we asked them to get the robot's attention and indicate when they have the robot's attention.
voice: hey, kismet, ah, there it is.
rb: so she realizes she has the robot's attention.
voice: kismet, do you like the toy? oh.
rb: now, here they're asked to prohibit the robot, and this first woman really pushes the robot into an emotional corner.
voice: no. no. you're not to do that. no.
rb: i'm going to leave it at that.
we put that together. then we put in turn taking.
when we talk to someone, we talk.
then we sort of raise our eyebrows, move our eyes, give the other person the idea it's their turn to talk.
and then they talk, and then we pass the baton back and forth between each other.
so we put this in the robot.
we got a bunch of naive subjects in, we didn't tell them anything about the robot, sat them down in front of the robot and said, talk to the robot.
now what they didn't know was, the robot wasn't understanding a word they said, and that the robot wasn't speaking english.
it was just saying random english phonemes.
and i want you to watch carefully, at the beginning of this, where this person, ritchie, who happened to talk to the robot for 25 minutes -- -- says, "i want to show you something.
i want to show you my watch."
and he brings the watch center, into the robot's field of vision, points to it, gives it a motion cue, and the robot looks at the watch quite successfully.
we don't know whether he understood or not that the robot -- notice the turn-taking.
ritchie: ok, i want to show you something. ok, this is a watch that my girlfriend gave me.
ritchie: yeah, look, it's got a little blue light in it too. i almost lost it this week.
rb: so it's making eye contact with him, following his eyes.
ritchie: can you do the same thing? robot: yeah, sure.
rb: and they successfully have that sort of communication.
and here's another aspect of the sorts of things that chris and i were doing.
this is another robot, cog.
they first make eye contact, and then, when christie looks over at this toy, the robot estimates her gaze direction and looks at the same thing that she's looking at.
so we're going to see more and more of this sort of robot over the next few years in labs.
but then the big questions, two big questions that people ask me are: if we make these robots more and more human-like, will we accept them, will we -- will they need rights eventually?
and the other question people ask me is, will they want to take over?
and on the first -- you know, this has been a very hollywood theme with lots of movies. you probably recognize these characters here -- where in each of these cases, the robots want more respect.
well, do you ever need to give robots respect?
they're just machines, after all.
but i think, you know, we have to accept that we are just machines.
after all, that's certainly what modern molecular biology says about us.
you don't see a description of how, you know, molecule a, you know, comes up and docks with this other molecule.
and it's moving forward, you know, propelled by various charges, and then the soul steps in and tweaks those molecules so that they connect.
it's all mechanistic. we are mechanism.
if we are machines, then in principle at least, we should be able to build machines out of other stuff, which are just as alive as we are.
but i think for us to admit that, we have to give up on our special-ness, in a certain way.
and we've had the retreat from special-ness under the barrage of science and technology many times over the last few hundred years, at least.
500 years ago we had to give up the idea that we are the center of the universe when the earth started to go around the sun; 150 years ago, with darwin, we had to give up the idea we were different from animals.
and to imagine -- you know, it's always hard for us.
recently we've been battered with the idea that maybe we didn't even have our own creation event, here on earth, which people didn't like much. and then the human genome said, maybe we only have 35,000 genes. and that was really -- people didn't like that, we've got more genes than that.
we don't like to give up our special-ness, so, you know, having the idea that robots could really have emotions, or that robots could be living creatures -- i think is going to be hard for us to accept.
but we're going to come to accept it over the next 50 years or so.
and the second question is, will the machines want to take over?
and here the standard scenario is that we create these things, they grow, we nurture them, they learn a lot from us, and then they start to decide that we're pretty boring, slow.
they want to take over from us.
and for those of you that have teenagers, you know what that's like.
but hollywood extends it to the robots.
and the question is, you know, will someone accidentally build a robot that takes over from us?
and that's sort of like this lone guy in the backyard, you know -- "i accidentally built a 747."
i don't think that's going to happen.
and i don't think -- -- i don't think we're going to deliberately build robots that we're uncomfortable with.
we'll -- you know, they're not going to have a super bad robot.
before that has to come to be a mildly bad robot, and before that a not so bad robot.
and we're just not going to let it go that way.
so, i think i'm going to leave it at that: the robots are coming, we don't have too much to worry about, it's going to be a lot of fun, and i hope you all enjoy the journey over the next 50 years.
rodney brooks: robots will invade our lives
in this prophetic talk from 2003, roboticist rodney brooks talks about how robots are going to work their way into our lives -- starting with toys and moving into household chores ... and beyond.
so a friend of mine who's a political scientist, he told me several months ago exactly what this month would be like.
he said, you know, there's this fiscal cliff coming, it's going to come at the beginning of 2013.
both parties absolutely need to resolve it, but neither party wants to be seen as the first to resolve it.
neither party has any incentive to solve it a second before it's due, so he said, december, you're just going to see lots of angry negotiations, negotiations breaking apart, reports of phone calls that aren't going well, people saying nothing's happening at all, and then sometime around christmas or new year's, we're going to hear, "okay, they resolved everything."
he told me that a few months ago. he said he's 98 percent positive they're going to resolve it, and i got an email from him today saying, all right, we're basically on track, but now i'm 80 percent positive that they're going to resolve it.
and it made me think. i love studying these moments in american history when there was this frenzy of partisan anger, that the economy was on the verge of total collapse.
the most famous early battle was alexander hamilton and thomas jefferson over what the dollar would be and how it would be backed up, with alexander hamilton saying, "we need a central bank, the first bank of the united states, or else the dollar will have no value.
this economy won't work," and thomas jefferson saying, "the people won't trust that.
they just fought off a king. they're not going to accept some central authority."
this battle defined the first 150 years of the u.s. economy, and at every moment, different partisans saying, "oh my god, the economy's about to collapse," and the rest of us just going about, spending our bucks on whatever it is we wanted to buy.
to give you a quick primer on where we are, a quick refresher on where we are.
so the fiscal cliff, i was told that that's too partisan a thing to say, although i can't remember which party it's supporting or attacking.
people say we should call it the fiscal slope, or we should call it an austerity crisis, but then other people say, no, that's even more partisan.
so i just call it the self-imposed, self-destructive arbitrary deadline about resolving an inevitable problem.
and this is what the inevitable problem looks like.
so this is a projection of u.s. debt as a percentage of our overall economy, of gdp.
the light blue dotted line represents the congressional budget office's best guess of what will happen if congress really doesn't do anything, and as you can see, sometime around 2027, we reach greek levels of debt, somewhere around 130 percent of gdp, which tells you that some time in the next 20 years, if congress does absolutely nothing, we're going to hit a moment where the world's investors, the world's bond buyers, are going to say, "we don't trust america anymore. we're not going to lend them any money, except at really high interest rates."
and at that moment our economy collapses.
but remember, greece is there today.
we're there in 20 years. we have lots and lots of time to avoid that crisis, and the fiscal cliff was just one more attempt at trying to force the two sides to resolve the crisis.
here's another way to look at exactly the same problem.
the dark blue line is how much the government spends.
the light blue line is how much the government gets in.
and as you can see, for most of recent history, except for a brief period, we have consistently spent more than we take in. thus the national debt.
but as you can also see, projected going forward, the gap widens a bit and raises a bit, and this graph is only through 2021.
it gets really, really ugly out towards 2030.
and this graph sort of sums up what the problem is.
the democrats, they say, well, this isn't a big deal.
we can just raise taxes a bit and close that gap, especially if we raise taxes on the rich.
the republicans say, hey, no, no, we've got a better idea.
why don't we lower both lines?
why don't we lower government spending and lower government taxes, and then we'll be on an even more favorable long-term deficit trajectory?
and behind this powerful disagreement between how to close that gap, there's the worst kind of cynical party politics, the worst kind of insider baseball, lobbying, all of that stuff, but there's also this powerfully interesting, respectful disagreement between two fundamentally different economic philosophies.
and i like to think, when i picture how republicans see the economy, what i picture is just some amazingly well-engineered machine, some perfect machine.
unfortunately, i picture it made in germany or japan, but this amazing machine that's constantly scouring every bit of human endeavor and taking resources, money, labor, capital, machinery, away from the least productive parts and towards the more productive parts, and while this might cause temporary dislocation, what it does is it builds up the more productive areas and lets the less productive areas fade away and die, and as a result the whole system is so much more efficient, so much richer for everybody.
and this view generally believes that there is a role for government, a small role, to set the rules so people aren't lying and cheating and hurting each other, maybe, you know, have a police force and a fire department and an army, but to have a very limited reach into the mechanisms of this machinery.
and when i picture how democrats and democratic-leaning economists picture this economy, most democratic economists are, you know, they're capitalists, they believe, yes, that's a good system a lot of the time.
it's good to let markets move resources to their more productive use.
but that system has tons of problems.
wealth piles up in the wrong places.
wealth is ripped away from people who shouldn't be called unproductive.
that's not going to create an equitable, fair society.
that machine doesn't care about the environment, about racism, about all these issues that make this life worse for all of us, and so the government does have a role to take resources from more productive uses, or from richer sources, and give them to other sources.
and when you think about the economy through these two different lenses, you understand why this crisis is so hard to solve, because the worse the crisis gets, the higher the stakes are, the more each side thinks they know the answer and the other side is just going to ruin everything.
and i can get really despairing. i've spent a lot of the last few years really depressed about this, until this year, i learned something that i felt really excited about. i feel like it's really good news, and it's so shocking, i don't like saying it, because i think people won't believe me.
but here's what i learned.
the american people, taken as a whole, when it comes to these issues, to fiscal issues, are moderate, pragmatic centrists.
and i know that's hard to believe, that the american people are moderate, pragmatic centrists.
but let me explain what i'm thinking.
when you look at how the federal government spends money, so this is the battle right here, 55 percent, more than half, is on social security, medicare, medicaid, a few other health programs, 20 percent defense, 19 percent discretionary, and six percent interest.
so when we're talking about cutting government spending, this is the pie we're talking about, and americans overwhelmingly, and it doesn't matter what party they're in, overwhelmingly like that big 55 percent chunk.
they like social security. they like medicare.
they even like medicaid, even though that goes to the poor and indigent, which you might think would have less support.
and they do not want it fundamentally touched, although the american people are remarkably comfortable, and democrats roughly equal to republicans, with some minor tweaks to make the system more stable.
social security is fairly easy to fix.
the rumors of its demise are always greatly exaggerated.
so gradually raise social security retirement age, maybe only on people not yet born.
americans are about 50/50, whether they're democrats or republicans.
reduce medicare for very wealthy seniors, seniors who make a lot of money. don't even eliminate it. just reduce it.
people generally are comfortable with it, democrats and republicans.
raise medical health care contributions?
everyone hates that equally, but republicans and democrats hate that together.
and so what this tells me is, when you look at the discussion of how to resolve our fiscal problems, we are not a nation that's powerfully divided on the major, major issue.
we're comfortable with it needing some tweaks, but we want to keep it.
we're not open to a discussion of eliminating it.
now there is one issue that is hyper-partisan, and where there is one party that is just spend, spend, spend, we don't care, spend some more, and that of course is republicans when it comes to military defense spending.
they way outweigh democrats.
the vast majority want to protect military defense spending.
that's 20 percent of the budget, and that presents a more difficult issue.
i should also note that the [discretionary] spending, which is about 19 percent of the budget, that is democratic and republican issues, so you do have welfare, food stamps, other programs that tend to be popular among democrats, but you also have the farm bill and all sorts of department of interior inducements for oil drilling and other things, which tend to be popular among republicans.
now when it comes to taxes, there is more disagreement.
that's a more partisan area.
you have democrats overwhelmingly supportive of raising the income tax on people who make 250,000 dollars a year, republicans sort of against it, although if you break it out by income, republicans who make less than 75,000 dollars a year like this idea.
so basically republicans who make more than 250,000 dollars a year don't want to be taxed.
raising taxes on investment income, you also see about two thirds of democrats but only one third of republicans are comfortable with that idea.
this brings up a really important point, which is that we tend in this country to talk about democrats and republicans and think there's this little group over there called independents that's, what, two percent?
if you add democrats, you add republicans, you've got the american people.
but that is not the case at all.
and it has not been the case for most of modern american history.
roughly a third of americans say that they are democrats.
around a quarter say that they are republicans.
a tiny little sliver call themselves libertarians, or socialists, or some other small third party, and the largest block, 40 percent, say they're independents.
so most americans are not partisan, and most of the people in the independent camp fall somewhere in between, so even though we have tremendous overlap between the views on these fiscal issues of democrats and republicans, we have even more overlap when you add in the independents.
now we get to fight about all sorts of other issues.
we get to hate each other on gun control and abortion and the environment, but on these fiscal issues, these important fiscal issues, we just are not anywhere nearly as divided as people say.
and in fact, there's this other group of people who are not as divided as people might think, and that group is economists.
i talk to a lot of economists, and back in the '70s and '80s it was ugly being an economist.
you were in what they called the saltwater camp, meaning harvard, princeton, mit, stanford, berkeley, or you were in the freshwater camp, university of chicago, university of rochester.
you were a free market capitalist economist or you were a keynesian liberal economist, and these people didn't go to each other's weddings, they snubbed each other at conferences.
it's still ugly to this day, but in my experience, it is really, really hard to find an economist under 40 who still has that kind of way of seeing the world.
the vast majority of economists -- it is so uncool to call yourself an ideologue of either camp.
the phrase that you want, if you're a graduate student or a postdoc or you're a professor, a 38-year-old economics professor, is, "i'm an empiricist.
i go by the data."
and the data is very clear.
none of these major theories have been completely successful.
the 20th century, the last hundred years, is riddled with disastrous examples of times that one school or the other tried to explain the past or predict the future and just did an awful, awful job, so the economics profession has acquired some degree of modesty.
they still are an awfully arrogant group of people, i will assure you, but they're now arrogant about their impartiality, and they, too, see a tremendous range of potential outcomes.
and this nonpartisanship is something that exists, that has existed in secret in america for years and years and years.
i've spent a lot of the fall talking to the three major organizations that survey american political attitudes: pew research, the university of chicago's national opinion research center, and the most important but the least known is the american national election studies group that is the world's longest, most respected poll of political attitudes.
they've been doing it since 1948, and what they show consistently throughout is that it's almost impossible to find americans who are consistent ideologically, who consistently support, "no we mustn't tax, and we must limit the size of government," or, "no, we must encourage government to play a larger role in redistribution and correcting the ills of capitalism."
those groups are very, very small.
the vast majority of people, they pick and choose, they see compromise and they change over time when they hear a better argument or a worse argument.
and that part of it has not changed.
what has changed is how people respond to vague questions.
if you ask people vague questions, like, "do you think there should be more government or less government?"
"do you think government should" — especially if you use loaded language -- "do you think the government should provide handouts?"
or, "do you think the government should redistribute?"
then you can see radical partisan change.
but when you get specific, when you actually ask about the actual taxing and spending issues under consideration, people are remarkably centrist, they're remarkably open to compromise.
so what we have, then, when you think about the fiscal cliff, don't think of it as the american people fundamentally can't stand each other on these issues and that we must be ripped apart into two separate warring nations.
think of it as a tiny, tiny number of ancient economists and misrepresentative ideologues have captured the process.
and they've captured the process through familiar ways, through a primary system which encourages that small group of people's voices, because that small group of people, the people who answer all yeses or all noes on those ideological questions, they might be small but every one of them has a blog, every one of them has been on fox or msnbc in the last week.
every one of them becomes a louder and louder voice, but they don't represent us.
they don't represent what our views are.
and that gets me back to the dollar, and it gets me back to reminding myself that we know this experience.
we know what it's like to have these people on tv, in congress, yelling about how the end of the world is coming if we don't adopt their view completely, because it's happened about the dollar ever since there's been a dollar.
we had the battle between jefferson and hamilton.
in 1913, we had this ugly battle over the federal reserve, when it was created, with vicious, angry arguments over how it would be constituted, and a general agreement that the way it was constituted was the worst possible compromise, a compromise guaranteed to destroy this valuable thing, this dollar, but then everyone agreeing, okay, so long as we're on the gold standard, it should be okay.
the fed can't mess it up so badly.
but then we got off the gold standard for individuals during the depression and we got off the gold standard as a source of international currency coordination during richard nixon's presidency.
each of those times, we were on the verge of complete collapse.
and nothing happened at all.
throughout it all, the dollar has been one of the most long-standing, stable, reasonable currencies, and we all use it every single day, no matter what the people screaming about tell us, no matter how scared we're supposed to be.
and this long-term fiscal picture that we're in right now, i think what is most maddening about it is, if congress were simply able to show not that they agree with each other, not that they're able to come up with the best possible compromise, but that they are able to just begin the process towards compromise, we all instantly are better off.
the fear is that the world is watching.
the fear is that the longer we delay any solution, the more the world will look to the u.s.
not as the bedrock of stability in the global economy, but as a place that can't resolve its own fights, and the longer we put that off, the more we make the world nervous, the higher interest rates are going to be, the quicker we're going to have to face a day of horrible calamity.
and so just the act of compromise itself, and sustained, real compromise, would give us even more time, would allow both sides even longer to spread out the pain and reach even more compromise down the road.
so i'm in the media. i feel like my job to make this happen is to help foster the things that seem to lead to compromise, to not talk about this in those vague and scary terms that do polarize us, but to just talk about it like what it is, not an existential crisis, not some battle between two fundamentally different religious views, but a math problem, a really solvable math problem, one where we're not all going to get what we want and one where, you know, there's going to be a little pain to spread around.
but the more we address it as a practical concern, the sooner we can resolve it, and the more time we have to resolve it, paradoxically.
adam davidson: what we learned from teetering on the fiscal cliff
at the end of 2012, the us political system was headed for the "fiscal cliff" -- a budget impasse that could only be solved with bipartisan agreement. adam davidson, cohost of "planet money," shares surprising data on how bipartisan we truly are -- and hints at the disconnect between representatives and the people they represent.
when i was little -- and by the way, i was little once -- my father told me a story about an 18th century watchmaker.
and what this guy had done: he used to produce these fabulously beautiful watches.
and one day, one of his customers came into his workshop and asked him to clean the watch that he'd bought.
and the guy took it apart, and one of the things he pulled out was one of the balance wheels.
and as he did so, his customer noticed that on the back side of the balance wheel was an engraving, were words.
and he said to the guy, "why have you put stuff on the back that no one will ever see?"
and the watchmaker turned around and said, "god can see it."
now i'm not in the least bit religious, neither was my father, but at that point, i noticed something happening here.
i felt something in this plexus of blood vessels and nerves, and there must be some muscles in there as well somewhere, i guess.
but i felt something.
and it was a physiological response.
and from that point on, from my age at the time, i began to think of things in a different way.
and as i took on my career as a designer, i began to ask myself the simple question: do we actually think beauty, or do we feel it?
now you probably know the answer to this already.
you probably think, well, i don't know which one you think it is, but i think it's about feeling beauty.
and so i then moved on into my design career and began to find some exciting things.
one of the most early work was done in automotive design -- some very exciting work was done there.
and during a lot of this work, we found something, or i found something, that really fascinated me, and maybe you can remember it.
do you remember when lights used to just go on and off, click click, when you closed the door in a car?
and then somebody, i think it was bmw, introduced a light that went out slowly.
remember that?
i remember it clearly.
do you remember the first time you were in a car and it did that?
i remember sitting there thinking, this is fantastic.
in fact, i've never found anybody that doesn't like the light that goes out slowly.
i thought, well what the hell's that about?
so i started to ask myself questions about it.
and the first was, i'd ask other people: "do you like it?" "yes."
"why?" and they'd say, "oh, it feels so natural," or, "it's nice."
i thought, well that's not good enough.
can we cut down a little bit further, because, as a designer, i need the vocabulary, i need the keyboard, of how this actually works.
and so i did some experiments.
and i suddenly realized that there was something that did exactly that -- light to dark in six seconds -- exactly that.
do you know what it is? anyone?
you see, using this bit, the thinky bit, the slow bit of the brain -- using that.
and this isn't a think, it's a feel.
and would you do me a favor?
for the next 14 minutes or whatever it is, will you feel stuff?
i don't need you to think so much as i want you to feel it.
i felt a sense of relaxation tempered with anticipation.
and that thing that i found was the cinema or the theater.
it's actually just happened here -- light to dark in six seconds.
and when that happens, are you sitting there going, "no, the movie's about to start," or are you going, "that's fantastic. i'm looking forward to it.
i get a sense of anticipation"?
now i'm not a neuroscientist.
i don't know even if there is something called a conditioned reflex.
but it might be.
because the people i speak to in the northern hemisphere that used to go in the cinema get this.
and some of the people i speak to that have never seen a movie or been to the theater don't get it in the same way.
everybody likes it, but some like it more than others.
so this leads me to think of this in a different way.
we're not feeling it. we're thinking beauty is in the limbic system -- if that's not an outmoded idea.
these are the bits, the pleasure centers, and maybe what i'm seeing and sensing and feeling is bypassing my thinking.
the wiring from your sensory apparatus to those bits is shorter than the bits that have to pass through the thinky bit, the cortex.
they arrive first.
so how do we make that actually work?
and how much of that reactive side of it is due to what we already know, or what we're going to learn, about something?
this is one of the most beautiful things i know.
it's a plastic bag.
and when i looked at it first, i thought, no, there's no beauty in that.
then i found out, post exposure, that this plastic bag if i put it into a filthy puddle or a stream filled with coliforms and all sorts of disgusting stuff, that that filthy water will migrate through the wall of the bag by osmosis and end up inside it as pure, potable drinking water.
and all of a sudden, this plastic bag was extremely beautiful to me.
now i'm going to ask you again to switch on the emotional bit.
would you mind taking the brain out, and i just want you to feel something.
look at that. what are you feeling about it?
is it beautiful? is it exciting?
i'm watching your faces very carefully.
there's some rather bored-looking gentlemen and some slightly engaged-looking ladies who are picking up something off that.
maybe there's an innocence to it.
now i'm going to tell you what it is. are you ready?
this is the last act on this earth of a little girl called heidi, five years old, before she died of cancer to the spine.
it's the last thing she did, the last physical act.
look at that picture.
look at the innocence. look at the beauty in it.
is it beautiful now?
stop. stop. how do you feel?
where are you feeling this?
i'm feeling it here. i feel it here.
and i'm watching your faces, because your faces are telling me something.
the lady over there is actually crying, by the way.
but what are you doing?
i watch what people do.
i watch faces.
i watch reactions.
because i have to know how people react to things.
and one of the most common faces on something faced with beauty, something stupefyingly delicious, is what i call the omg.
and by the way, there's no pleasure in that face.
it's not a "this is wonderful!"
the eyebrows are doing this, the eyes are defocused, and the mouth is hanging open.
that's not the expression of joy.
there's something else in that.
there's something weird happening.
so pleasure seems to be tempered by a whole series of different things coming in.
poignancy is a word i love as a designer.
it means something triggering a big emotional response, often quite a sad emotional response, but it's part of what we do.
it isn't just about nice.
and this is the dilemma, this is the paradox, of beauty.
sensorily, we're taking in all sorts of things -- mixtures of things that are good, bad, exciting, frightening -- to come up with that sensorial exposure, that sensation of what's going on.
pathos appears obviously as part of what you just saw in that little girl's drawing.
and also triumph, this sense of transcendence, this "i never knew that. ah, this is something new."
and that's packed in there as well.
and as we assemble these tools, from a design point of view, i get terribly excited about it, because these are things, as we've already said, they're arriving at the brain, it would seem, before cognition, before we can manipulate them -- electrochemical party tricks.
now what i'm also interested in is: is it possible to separate intrinsic and extrinsic beauty?
by that, i mean intrinsically beautiful things, just something that's exquisitely beautiful, that's universally beautiful.
very hard to find. maybe you've got some examples of it.
very hard to find something that, to everybody, is a very beautiful thing, without a certain amount of information packed in there before.
so a lot of it tends to be extrinsic.
it's mediated by information before the comprehension.
or the information's added on at the back, like that little girl's drawing that i showed you.
now when talking about beauty you can't get away from the fact that a lot experiments have been done in this way with faces and what have you.
and one of the most tedious ones, i think, was saying that beauty was about symmetry.
well it obviously isn't.
this is a more interesting one where half faces were shown to some people, and then to add them into a list of most beautiful to least beautiful and then exposing a full face.
and they found that it was almost exact coincidence.
so it wasn't about symmetry.
in fact, this lady has a particularly asymmetrical face, of which both sides are beautiful.
but they're both different.
and as a designer, i can't help meddling with this, so i pulled it to bits and sort of did stuff like this, and tried to understand what the individual elements were, but feeling it as i go.
now i can feel a sensation of delight and beauty if i look at that eye.
i'm not getting it off the eyebrow.
and the earhole isn't doing it to me at all.
so i don't know how much this is helping me, but it's helping to guide me to the places where the signals are coming off.
and as i say, i'm not a neuroscientist, but to understand how i can start to assemble things that will very quickly bypass this thinking part and get me to the enjoyable precognitive elements.
anais nin and the talmud have told us time and time again that we see things not as they are, but as we are.
so i'm going to shamelessly expose something to you, which is beautiful to me.
and this is the f1 mv agusta.
it is really -- i mean, i can't express to you how exquisite this object is.
but i also know why it's exquisite to me, because it's a palimpsest of things.
it's masses and masses of layers.
this is just the bit that protrudes into our physical dimension.
it's something much bigger.
layer after layer of legend, sport, details that resonate.
i mean, if i just go through some of them now -- i know about laminar flow when it comes to air-piercing objects, and that does it consummately well, you can see it can.
so that's getting me excited.
and i feel that here.
this bit, the big secret of automotive design -- reflection management.
it's not about the shapes, it's how the shapes reflect light.
now that thing, light flickers across it as you move, so it becomes a kinetic object, even though it's standing still -- managed by how brilliantly that's done on the reflection.
this little relief on the footplate, by the way, to a rider means there's something going on underneath it -- in this case, a drive chain running at 300 miles and hour probably, taking the power from the engine.
i'm getting terribly excited as my mind and my eyes flick across these things.
titanium lacquer on this.
i can't tell you how wonderful this is.
that's how you stop the nuts coming off at high speed on the wheel.
i'm really getting into this now.
and of course, a racing bike doesn't have a prop stand, but this one, because it's a road bike, it all goes away and it folds into this little gap.
so it disappears.
and then i can't tell you how hard it is to do that radiator, which is curved.
why would you do that?
because i know we need to bring the wheel farther into the aerodynamics.
so it's more expensive, but it's wonderful.
and to cap it all, brand royalty -- agusta, count agusta, from the great histories of this stuff.
the bit that you can't see is the genius that created this.
they call him "the plumber" in italy, as well as "maestro," because he actually is engineer and craftsman and sculptor at the same time.
there's so little compromise on this, you can't see it.
but unfortunately, the likes of me and people that are like me have to deal with compromise all the time with beauty.
we have to deal with it.
so i have to work with a supply chain, and i've got to work with the technologies, and i've got to work with everything else all the time, and so compromises start to fit into it.
and so look at her.
i've had to make a bit of a compromise there.
i've had to move that part across, but only a millimeter.
no one's noticed, have they yet?
did you see what i did?
i moved three things by a millimeter.
pretty? yes.
beautiful? maybe lesser.
but then, of course, the consumer says that doesn't really matter.
so that's okay, isn't it?
another millimeter?
no one's going to notice those split lines and changes.
it's that easy to lose beauty, because beauty's incredibly difficult to do.
and only a few people can do it.
and a focus group cannot do it.
and a team rarely can do it.
it takes a central cortex, if you like, to be able to orchestrate all those elements at the same time.
this is a beautiful water bottle -- some of you know of it -- done by ross lovegrove, the designer.
this is pretty close to intrinsic beauty. this one, as long as you know what water is like then you can experience this.
it's lovely because it is an embodiment of something refreshing and delicious.
i might like it more than you like it, because i know how bloody hard it is to do it.
it's stupefyingly difficult to make something that refracts light like that, that comes out of the tool correctly, that goes down the line without falling over.
underneath this, like the story of the swan, is a million things very difficult to do.
so all hail to that.
it's a fantastic example, a simple object.
and the one i showed you before was, of course, a massively complex one.
and they're working in beauty in slightly different ways because of it.
you all, i guess, like me, enjoy watching a ballet dancer dance.
and part of the joy of it is, you know the difficulty.
you also may be taking into account the fact that it's incredibly painful.
anybody seen a ballet dancer's toes when they come out of the points?
while she's doing these graceful arabesques and plies and what have you, something horrible's going on down here.
the comprehension of it leads us to a greater and heightened sense of the beauty of what's actually going on.
now i'm using microseconds wrongly here, so please ignore me.
but what i have to do now, feeling again, what i've got to do is to be able to supply enough of these enzymes, of these triggers into something early on in the process, that you pick it up, not through your thinking, but through your feeling.
so we're going to have a little experiment.
right, are you ready? i'm going to show you something for a very, very brief moment.
did you think that was a bicycle when i showed it to you at the first flash?
it's not.
tell me something, did you think it was quick when you first saw it? yes you did.
did you think it was modern? yes you did.
that blip, that information, shot into you before that.
and because your brain starter motor began there, now it's got to deal with it.
and the great thing is, this motorcycle has been styled this way specifically to engender a sense that it's green technology and it's good for you and it's light and it's all part of the future.
so is that wrong?
well in this case it isn't, because it's a very, very ecologically-sound piece of technology.
but you're a slave of that first flash.
we are slaves to the first few fractions of a second -- and that's where much of my work has to win or lose, on a shelf in a shop.
it wins or loses at that point.
you may see 50, 100, 200 things on a shelf as you walk down it, but i have to work within that domain, to ensure that it gets you there first.
and finally, the layer that i love, of knowledge.
some of you, i'm sure, will be familiar with this.
what's incredible about this, and the way i love to come back to it, is this is taking something that you hate or bores you, folding clothes, and if you can actually do this -- who can actually do this? anybody try to do this?
it's fantastic, isn't it?
look at that. do you want to see it again?
no time. it says i have two minutes left, so we can't do this.
but just go to the web, youtube, pull it down, "folding t-shirt."
that's how underpaid younger-aged people have to fold your t-shirt.
you didn't maybe know it.
but how do you feel about it?
it feels fantastic when you do it, you look forward to doing it, and when you tell somebody else about it -- like you probably have -- you look really smart.
the knowledge bubble that sits around the outside, the stuff that costs nothing, because that knowledge is free -- bundle that together and where do we come out?
only sometimes. only sometimes.
form is function. form is function.
it informs, it tells us, it supplies us answers before we've even thought about it.
and so i've stopped using words like "form," and i've stopped using words like "function" as a designer.
what i try to pursue now is the emotional functionality of things.
because if i can get that right, i can make them wonderful, and i can make them repeatedly wonderful.
and you know what those products and services are, because you own some of them.
they're the things that you'd snatch if the house was on fire.
forming the emotional bond between this thing and you is an electrochemical party trick that happens before you even think about it.
thank you very much.
richard seymour: how beauty feels
a story, a work of art, a face, a designed object -- how do we tell that something is beautiful? and why does it matter so much to us? designer richard seymour explores our response to beauty and the surprising power of objects that exhibit it.
one of the most common ways of dividing the world is into those who believe and those who don't -- into the religious and the atheists.
and for the last decade or so, it's been quite clear what being an atheist means.
there have been some very vocal atheists who've pointed out, not just that religion is wrong, but that it's ridiculous.
these people, many of whom have lived in north oxford, have argued -- they've argued that believing in god is akin to believing in fairies and essentially that the whole thing is a childish game.
now i think it's too easy.
i think it's too easy to dismiss the whole of religion that way.
and it's as easy as shooting fish in a barrel.
and what i'd like to inaugurate today is a new way of being an atheist -- if you like, a new version of atheism we could call atheism 2.0.
now what is atheism 2.0?
well it starts from a very basic premise: of course, there's no god.
of course, there are no deities or supernatural spirits or angels, etc.
now let's move on; that's not the end of the story, that's the very, very beginning.
i'm interested in the kind of constituency that thinks something along these lines: that thinks, "i can't believe in any of this stuff.
i can't believe in the doctrines.
i don't think these doctrines are right.
but," a very important but, "i love christmas carols.
i really like the art of mantegna.
i really like looking at old churches.
i really like turning the pages of the old testament."
whatever it may be, you know the kind of thing i'm talking about -- people who are attracted to the ritualistic side, the moralistic, communal side of religion, but can't bear the doctrine.
until now, these people have faced a rather unpleasant choice.
it's almost as though either you accept the doctrine and then you can have all the nice stuff, or you reject the doctrine and you're living in some kind of spiritual wasteland under the guidance of cnn and walmart.
so that's a sort of tough choice.
i don't think we have to make that choice.
i think there is an alternative.
i think there are ways -- and i'm being both very respectful and completely impious -- of stealing from religions.
if you don't believe in a religion, there's nothing wrong with picking and mixing, with taking out the best sides of religion.
and for me, atheism 2.0 is about both, as i say, a respectful and an impious way of going through religions and saying, "what here could we use?"
the secular world is full of holes.
we have secularized badly, i would argue.
and a thorough study of religion could give us all sorts of insights into areas of life that are not going too well.
and i'd like to run through a few of these today.
i'd like to kick off by looking at education.
now education is a field the secular world really believes in.
when we think about how we're going to make the world a better place, we think education; that's where we put a lot of money.
education is going to give us, not only commercial skills, industrial skills, it's also going to make us better people.
you know the kind of thing a commencement address is, and graduation ceremonies, those lyrical claims that education, the process of education -- particularly higher education -- will make us into nobler and better human beings.
that's a lovely idea.
interesting where it came from.
in the early 19th century, church attendance in western europe started sliding down very, very sharply, and people panicked.
they asked themselves the following question.
they said, where are people going to find the morality, where are they going to find guidance, and where are they going to find sources of consolation?
and influential voices came up with one answer.
it's to culture that we should look for guidance, for consolation, for morality.
let's look to the plays of shakespeare, the dialogues of plato, the novels of jane austen.
in there, we'll find a lot of the truths that we might previously have found in the gospel of saint john.
now i think that's a very beautiful idea and a very true idea.
they wanted to replace scripture with culture.
and that's a very plausible idea.
it's also an idea that we have forgotten.
if you went to a top university -- let's say you went to harvard or oxford or cambridge -- and you said, "i've come here because i'm in search of morality, guidance and consolation; i want to know how to live," they would show you the way to the insane asylum.
this is simply not what our grandest and best institutes of higher learning are in the business of.
why? they don't think we need it.
they don't think we are in an urgent need of assistance.
they see us as adults, rational adults.
what we need is information.
now religions start from a very different place indeed.
all religions, all major religions, at various points call us children.
and like children, they believe that we are in severe need of assistance.
we're only just holding it together.
perhaps this is just me, maybe you.
but anyway, we're only just holding it together.
and we need help. of course, we need help.
and so we need guidance and we need didactic learning.
you know, in the 18th century in the u.k., the greatest preacher, greatest religious preacher, was a man called john wesley, who went up and down this country delivering sermons, advising people how they could live.
he delivered sermons on the duties of parents to their children and children to their parents, the duties of the rich to the poor and the poor to the rich.
he was trying to tell people how they should live through the medium of sermons, the classic medium of delivery of religions.
now we've given up with the idea of sermons.
if you said to a modern liberal individualist, "hey, how about a sermon?"
they'd go, "no, no. i don't need one of those.
i'm an independent, individual person."
what's the difference between a sermon and our modern, secular mode of delivery, the lecture?
well a sermon wants to change your life and a lecture wants to give you a bit of information.
and i think we need to get back to that sermon tradition.
the tradition of sermonizing is hugely valuable, because we are in need of guidance, morality and consolation -- and religions know that.
another point about education: we tend to believe in the modern secular world that if you tell someone something once, they'll remember it.
sit them in a classroom, tell them about plato at the age of 20, send them out for a career in management consultancy for 40 years, and that lesson will stick with them.
religions go, "nonsense.
you need to keep repeating the lesson 10 times a day.
so get on your knees and repeat it."
that's what all religions tell us: "get on you knees and repeat it 10 or 20 or 15 times a day."
otherwise our minds are like sieves.
so religions are cultures of repetition.
they circle the great truths again and again and again.
we associate repetition with boredom.
"give us the new," we're always saying.
"the new is better than the old."
if i said to you, "okay, we're not going to have new ted.
we're just going to run through all the old ones and watch them five times because they're so true.
we're going to watch elizabeth gilbert five times because what she says is so clever," you'd feel cheated.
not so if you're adopting a religious mindset.
the other things that religions do is to arrange time.
all the major religions give us calendars.
what is a calendar?
a calendar is a way of making sure that across the year you will bump into certain very important ideas.
in the catholic chronology, catholic calendar, at the end of march you will think about st. jerome and his qualities of humility and goodness and his generosity to the poor.
you won't do that by accident; you will do that because you are guided to do that.
now we don't think that way.
in the secular world we think, "if an idea is important, i'll bump into it.
i'll just come across it."
nonsense, says the religious world view.
religious view says we need calendars, we need to structure time, we need to synchronize encounters.
this comes across also in the way in which religions set up rituals around important feelings.
take the moon. it's really important to look at the moon.
you know, when you look at the moon, you think, "i'm really small. what are my problems?"
it sets things into perspective, etc., etc.
we should all look at the moon a bit more often. we don't.
why don't we? well there's nothing to tell us, "look at the moon."
but if you're a zen buddhist in the middle of september, you will be ordered out of your home, made to stand on a canonical platform and made to celebrate the festival of tsukimi, where you will be given poems to read in honor of the moon and the passage of time and the frailty of life that it should remind us of.
you'll be handed rice cakes.
and the moon and the reflection on the moon will have a secure place in your heart.
that's very good.
the other thing that religions are really aware of is: speak well -- i'm not doing a very good job of this here -- but oratory, oratory is absolutely key to religions.
in the secular world, you can come through the university system and be a lousy speaker and still have a great career.
but the religious world doesn't think that way.
what you're saying needs to be backed up by a really convincing way of saying it.
so if you go to an african american pentecostalist church in the american south and you listen to how they talk, my goodness, they talk well.
after every convincing point, people will go, "amen, amen, amen."
at the end of a really rousing paragraph, they'll all stand up, and they'll go, "thank you jesus, thank you christ, thank you savior."
if we were doing it like they do it -- let's not do it, but if we were to do it -- i would tell you something like, "culture should replace scripture."
and you would go, "amen, amen, amen."
and at the end of my talk, you would all stand up and you would go, "thank you plato, thank you shakespeare, thank you jane austen."
and we'd know that we had a real rhythm going.
all right, all right. we're getting there. we're getting there.
the other thing that religions know is we're not just brains, we are also bodies.
and when they teach us a lesson, they do it via the body.
so for example, take the jewish idea of forgiveness.
jews are very interested in forgiveness and how we should start anew and start afresh.
they don't just deliver us sermons on this.
they don't just give us books or words about this.
they tell us to have a bath.
so in orthodox jewish communities, every friday you go to a mikveh.
you immerse yourself in the water, and a physical action backs up a philosophical idea.
we don't tend to do that.
our ideas are in one area and our behavior with our bodies is in another.
religions are fascinating in the way they try and combine the two.
let's look at art now.
now art is something that in the secular world, we think very highly of. we think art is really, really important.
a lot of our surplus wealth goes to museums, etc.
we sometimes hear it said that museums are our new cathedrals, or our new churches.
you've heard that saying.
now i think that the potential is there, but we've completely let ourselves down.
and the reason we've let ourselves down is that we're not properly studying how religions handle art.
the two really bad ideas that are hovering in the modern world that inhibit our capacity to draw strength from art: the first idea is that art should be for art's sake -- a ridiculous idea -- an idea that art should live in a hermetic bubble and should not try to do anything with this troubled world.
i couldn't disagree more.
the other thing that we believe is that art shouldn't explain itself, that artists shouldn't say what they're up to, because if they said it, it might destroy the spell and we might find it too easy.
that's why a very common feeling when you're in a museum -- let's admit it -- is, "i don't know what this is about."
but if we're serious people, we don't admit to that.
but that feeling of puzzlement is structural to contemporary art.
now religions have a much saner attitude to art.
they have no trouble telling us what art is about.
art is about two things in all the major faiths.
firstly, it's trying to remind you of what there is to love.
and secondly, it's trying to remind you of what there is to fear and to hate.
and that's what art is.
art is a visceral encounter with the most important ideas of your faith.
so as you walk around a church, or a mosque or a cathedral, what you're trying to imbibe, what you're imbibing is, through your eyes, through your senses, truths that have otherwise come to you through your mind.
essentially it's propaganda.
rembrandt is a propagandist in the christian view.
now the word "propaganda" sets off alarm bells.
we think of hitler, we think of stalin. don't, necessarily.
propaganda is a manner of being didactic in honor of something.
and if that thing is good, there's no problem with it at all.
my view is that museums should take a leaf out of the book of religions.
and they should make sure that when you walk into a museum -- if i was a museum curator, i would make a room for love, a room for generosity.
all works of art are talking to us about things.
and if we were able to arrange spaces where we could come across works where we would be told, use these works of art to cement these ideas in your mind, we would get a lot more out of art.
art would pick up the duty that it used to have and that we've neglected because of certain mis-founded ideas.
art should be one of the tools by which we improve our society.
art should be didactic.
let's think of something else.
the people in the modern world, in the secular world, who are interested in matters of the spirit, in matters of the mind, in higher soul-like concerns, tend to be isolated individuals.
they're poets, they're philosophers, they're photographers, they're filmmakers.
and they tend to be on their own.
they're our cottage industries. they are vulnerable, single people.
and they get depressed and they get sad on their own.
and they don't really change much.
now think about religions, think about organized religions.
what do organized religions do?
they group together, they form institutions.
and that has all sorts of advantages.
first of all, scale, might.
the catholic church pulled in 97 billion dollars last year according to the wall street journal.
these are massive machines.
they're collaborative, they're branded, they're multinational, and they're highly disciplined.
these are all very good qualities.
we recognize them in relation to corporations.
and corporations are very like religions in many ways, except they're right down at the bottom of the pyramid of needs.
they're selling us shoes and cars.
whereas the people who are selling us the higher stuff -- the therapists, the poets -- are on their own and they have no power, they have no might.
so religions are the foremost example of an institution that is fighting for the things of the mind.
now we may not agree with what religions are trying to teach us, but we can admire the institutional way in which they're doing it.
books alone, books written by lone individuals, are not going to change anything.
we need to group together.
if you want to change the world, you have to group together, you have to be collaborative.
and that's what religions do.
they are multinational, as i say, they are branded, they have a clear identity, so they don't get lost in a busy world.
that's something we can learn from.
i want to conclude.
really what i want to say is for many of you who are operating in a range of different fields, there is something to learn from the example of religion -- even if you don't believe any of it.
if you're involved in anything that's communal, that involves lots of people getting together, there are things for you in religion.
if you're involved, say, in a travel industry in any way, look at pilgrimage.
look very closely at pilgrimage.
we haven't begun to scratch the surface of what travel could be because we haven't looked at what religions do with travel.
if you're in the art world, look at the example of what religions are doing with art.
and if you're an educator in any way, again, look at how religions are spreading ideas.
you may not agree with the ideas, but my goodness, they're highly effective mechanisms for doing so.
so really my concluding point is you may not agree with religion, but at the end of the day, religions are so subtle, so complicated, so intelligent in many ways that they're not fit to be abandoned to the religious alone; they're for all of us.
thank you very much.
now this is actually a courageous talk, because you're kind of setting up yourself in some ways to be ridiculed in some quarters.
you can get shot by both sides.
you can get shot by the hard-headed atheists, and you can get shot by those who fully believe.
incoming missiles from north oxford at any moment.
but you left out one aspect of religion that a lot of people might say your agenda could borrow from, which is this sense -- that's actually probably the most important thing to anyone who's religious -- of spiritual experience, of some kind of connection with something that's bigger than you are.
is there any room for that experience in atheism 2.0?
absolutely. i, like many of you, meet people who say things like, "but isn't there something bigger than us, something else?"
and i say, "of course." and they say, "so aren't you sort of religious?"
and i go, "no." why does that sense of mystery, that sense of the dizzying scale of the universe, need to be accompanied by a mystical feeling?
science and just observation gives us that feeling without it, so i don't feel the need.
the universe is large and we are tiny, without the need for further religious superstructure.
so one can have so-called spiritual moments without belief in the spirit.
actually, let me just ask a question.
how many people here would say that religion is important to them?
is there an equivalent process by which there's a sort of bridge between what you're talking about and what you would say to them?
i would say that there are many, many gaps in secular life and these can be plugged.
it's not as though, as i try to suggest, it's not as though either you have religion and then you have to accept all sorts of things, or you don't have religion and then you're cut off from all these very good things.
it's so sad that we constantly say, "i don't believe so i can't have community, so i'm cut off from morality, so i can't go on a pilgrimage."
one wants to say, "nonsense. why not?"
and that's really the spirit of my talk.
there's so much we can absorb.
atheism shouldn't cut itself off from the rich sources of religion.
it seems to me that there's plenty of people in the ted community who are atheists.
but probably most people in the community certainly don't think that religion is going away any time soon and want to find the language to have a constructive dialogue and to feel like we can actually talk to each other and at least share some things in common.
are we foolish to be optimistic about the possibility of a world where, instead of religion being the great rallying cry of divide and war, that there could be bridging?
no, we need to be polite about differences.
politeness is a much-overlooked virtue.
it's seen as hypocrisy.
but we need to get to a stage when you're an atheist and someone says, "well you know, i did pray the other day," you politely ignore it.
because you've agreed on 90 percent of things, because you have a shared view on so many things, and you politely differ.
and i think that's what the religious wars of late have ignored.
they've ignored the possibility of harmonious disagreement.
and finally, does this new thing that you're proposing that's not a religion but something else, does it need a leader, and are you volunteering to be the pope?
well, one thing that we're all very suspicious of is individual leaders.
it doesn't need it.
what i've tried to lay out is a framework and i'm hoping that people can just fill it in.
i've sketched a sort of broad framework.
but wherever you are, as i say, if you're in the travel industry, do that travel bit.
if you're in the communal industry, look at religion and do the communal bit.
so it's a wiki project.
alain, thank you for sparking many conversations later.
what aspects of religion should atheists adopt? alain de botton suggests a "religion for atheists" -- call it atheism 2.0 -- that incorporates religious forms and traditions to satisfy our human need for connection, ritual and transcendence.
i would like to talk today about what i think is one of the greatest adventures human beings have embarked upon, which is the quest to understand the universe and our place in it.
my own interest in this subject, and my passion for it, began rather accidentally.
i had bought a copy of this book, "the universe and dr. einstein" -- a used paperback from a secondhand bookstore in seattle.
a few years after that, in bangalore, i was finding it hard to fall asleep one night, and i picked up this book, thinking it would put me to sleep in 10 minutes.
and as it happened, i read it from midnight to five in the morning in one shot.
and i was left with this intense feeling of awe and exhilaration at the universe and our own ability to understand as much as we do.
and that feeling hasn't left me yet.
that feeling was the trigger for me to actually change my career -- from being a software engineer to become a science writer -- so that i could partake in the joy of science, and also the joy of communicating it to others.
and that feeling also led me to a pilgrimage of sorts, to go literally to the ends of the earth to see telescopes, detectors, instruments that people are building, or have built, in order to probe the cosmos in greater and greater detail.
so it took me from places like chile -- the atacama desert in chile -- to siberia, to underground mines in the japanese alps, in northern america, all the way to antarctica and even to the south pole.
and today i would like to share with you some images, some stories of these trips.
i have been basically spending the last few years documenting the efforts of some extremely intrepid men and women who are putting, literally at times, their lives at stake working in some very remote and very hostile places so that they may gather the faintest signals from the cosmos in order for us to understand this universe.
and i first begin with a pie chart -- and i promise this is the only pie chart in the whole presentation -- but it sets up the state of our knowledge of the cosmos.
all the theories in physics that we have today properly explain what is called normal matter -- the stuff that we're all made of -- and that's four percent of the universe.
astronomers and cosmologists and physicists think that there is something called dark matter in the universe, which makes up 23 percent of the universe, and something called dark energy, which permeates the fabric of space-time, that makes up another 73 percent.
so if you look at this pie chart, 96 percent of the universe, at this point in our exploration of it, is unknown or not well understood.
and most of the experiments, telescopes that i went to see are in some way addressing this question, these two twin mysteries of dark matter and dark energy.
i will take you first to an underground mine in northern minnesota where people are looking for something called dark matter.
and the idea here is that they are looking for a sign of a dark matter particle hitting one of their detectors.
and the reason why they have to go underground is that, if you did this experiment on the surface of the earth, the same experiment would be swamped by signals that could be created by things like cosmic rays, ambient radio activity, even our own bodies. you might not believe it, but even our own bodies are radioactive enough to disturb this experiment.
so they go deep inside mines to find a kind of environmental silence that will allow them to hear the ping of a dark matter particle hitting their detector.
and i went to see one of these experiments, and this is actually -- you can barely see it, and the reason for that is it's entirely dark in there -- this is a cavern that was left behind by the miners who left this mine in 1960.
and physicists came and started using it sometime in the 1980s.
and the miners in the early part of the last century worked, literally, in candlelight.
and today, you would see this inside the mine, half a mile underground.
this is one of the largest underground labs in the world.
and, among other things, they're looking for dark matter.
there is another way to search for dark matter, which is indirectly.
if dark matter exists in our universe, in our galaxy, then these particles should be smashing together and producing other particles that we know about -- one of them being neutrinos.
and neutrinos you can detect by the signature they leave when they hit water molecules.
when a neutrino hits a water molecule it emits a kind of blue light, a flash of blue light, and by looking for this blue light, you can essentially understand something about the neutrino and then, indirectly, something about the dark matter that might have created this neutrino.
but you need very, very large volumes of water in order to do this.
you need something like tens of megatons of water -- almost a gigaton of water -- in order to have any chance of catching this neutrino.
and where in the world would you find such water?
well the russians have a tank in their own backyard.
this is lake baikal.
it is the largest lake in the world. it's 800 km long.
it's about 40 to 50 km wide in most places, and one to two kilometers deep.
and what the russians are doing is they're building these detectors and immersing them about a kilometer beneath the surface of the lake so that they can watch for these flashes of blue light.
and this is the scene that greeted me when i landed there.
this is lake baikal in the peak of the siberian winter.
the lake is entirely frozen.
and the line of black dots that you see in the background, that's the ice camp where the physicists are working.
the reason why they have to work in winter is because they don't have the money to work in summer and spring, which, if they did that, they would need ships and submersibles to do their work.
so they wait until winter -- the lake is completely frozen over -- and they use this meter-thick ice as a platform on which to establish their ice camp and do their work.
so this is the russians working on the ice in the peak of the siberian winter.
they have to drill holes in the ice, dive down into the water -- cold, cold water -- to get hold of the instrument, bring it up, do any repairs and maintenance that they need to do, put it back and get out before the ice melts.
because that phase of solid ice lasts for two months and it's full of cracks.
and you have to imagine, there's an entire sea-like lake underneath, moving.
i still don't understand this one russian man working in his bare chest, but that tells you how hard he was working.
and these people, a handful of people, have been working for 20 years, looking for particles that may or may not exist.
and they have dedicated their lives to it.
and just to give you an idea, they have spent 20 million over 20 years.
it's very harsh conditions.
they work on a shoestring budget.
the toilets there are literally holes in the ground covered with a wooden shack.
and it's that basic, but they do this every year.
from siberia to the atacama desert in chile, to see something called the very large telescope.
the very large telescope is one of these things that astronomers do -- they name their telescopes rather unimaginatively.
i can tell you for a fact, that the next one that they're planning is called the extremely large telescope.
and you wouldn't believe it, but the one after that is going to be called the overwhelmingly large telescope.
but nonetheless, it's an extraordinary piece of engineering.
these are four 8.2 meter telescopes.
and these telescopes, among other things, they're being used to study how the expansion of the universe is changing with time.
and the more you understand that, the better you would understand what this dark energy that the universe is made of is all about.
and one piece of engineering that i want to leave you with as regards this telescope is the mirror.
each mirror, there are four of them, is made of a single piece of glass, a monolithic piece of high-tech ceramic, that has been ground down and polished to such accuracy that the only way to understand what that is is [to] imagine a city like paris, with all its buildings and the eiffel tower, if you grind down paris to that kind of accuracy, you would be left with bumps that are one millimeter high.
and that's the kind of polishing that these mirrors have endured.
an extraordinary set of telescopes.
here's another view of the same.
the reason why you have to build these telescopes in places like the atacama desert is because of the high altitude desert.
the dry air is really good for telescopes, and also, the cloud cover is below the summit of these mountains so that the telescopes have about 300 days of clear skies.
finally, i want to take you to antarctica.
i want to spend most of my time on this part of the world.
this is cosmology's final frontier.
some of the most amazing experiments, some of the most extreme experiments, are being done in antarctica.
i was there to view something called a long-duration balloon flight, which basically takes telescopes and instruments all the way to the upper atmosphere, the upper stratosphere, 40 km up.
and that's where they do their experiments, and then the balloon, the payload, is brought down.
so this is us landing on the ross ice shelf in antarctica.
that's an american c-17 cargo plane that flew us from new zealand to mcmurdo in antarctica.
and here we are about to board our bus.
and i don't know if you can read the lettering, but it says, "ivan the terribus."
and that's taking us to mcmurdo.
and this is the scene that greets you in mcmurdo.
and you barely might be able to make out this hut here.
this hut was built by robert falcon scott and his men when they first came to antarctica on their first expedition to go to the south pole.
because it's so cold, the entire contents of that hut is still as they left it, with the remnants of the last meal they cooked still there.
it's an extraordinary place.
this is mcmurdo itself. about a thousand people work here in summer, and about 200 in winter when it's completely dark for six months.
i was here to see the launch of this particular type of instrument.
this is a cosmic ray experiment that has been launched all the way to the upper-stratosphere to an altitude of 40 km.
what i want you to imagine is this is two tons in weight.
so you're using a balloon to carry something that is two tons all the way to an altitude of 40 km.
and the engineers, the technicians, the physicists have all got to assemble on the ross ice shelf, because antarctica -- i won't go into the reasons why -- but it's one of the most favorable places for doing these balloon launches, except for the weather.
the weather, as you can imagine, this is summer, and you're standing on 200 ft of ice.
and there's a volcano behind, which has glaciers at the very top.
and what they have to do is they have to assemble the entire balloon -- the fabric, parachute and everything -- on the ice and then fill it up with helium.
and that process takes about two hours.
and the weather can change as they're putting together this whole assembly.
for instance, here they are laying down the balloon fabric behind, which is eventually going to be filled up with helium.
those two trucks you see at the very end carry 12 tanks each of compressed helium.
now, in case the weather changes before the launch, they have to actually pack everything back up into their boxes and take it out back to mcmurdo station.
and this particular balloon, because it has to launch two tons of weight, is an extremely huge balloon.
the fabric alone weighs two tons.
in order to minimize the weight, it's very thin, it's as thin as a sandwich wrapper.
and if they have to pack it back, they have to put it into boxes and stamp on it so that it fits into the box again -- except, when they did it first, it would have been done in texas.
here, they can't do it with the kind shoes they're wearing, so they have to take their shoes off, get barefoot into the boxes, in this cold, and do that kind of work.
that's the kind of dedication these people have.
here's the balloon being filled up with helium, and you can see it's a gorgeous sight.
here's a scene that shows you the balloon and the payload end-to-end.
so the balloon is being filled up with helium on the left-hand side, and the fabric actually runs all the way to the middle where there's a piece of electronics and explosives being connected to a parachute, and then the parachute is then connected to the payload.
and remember, all this wiring is being done by people in extreme cold, in sub-zero temperatures.
they're wearing about 15 kg of clothing and stuff, but they have to take their gloves off in order to do that.
and i would like to share with you a launch.
radio: okay, release the balloon, release the balloon, release the balloon.
anil ananthaswamy: and i'll finally like to leave you with two images.
this is an observatory in the himalayas, in ladakh in india.
and the thing i want you to look at here is the telescope on the right-hand side.
and on the far left there is a 400 year-old buddhist monastery.
this is a close-up of the buddhist monastery.
and i was struck by the juxtaposition of these two enormous disciplines that humanity has.
one is exploring the cosmos on the outside, and the other one is exploring our interior being.
and both require silence of some sort.
and what struck me was every place that i went to to see these telescopes, the astronomers and cosmologists are in search of a certain kind of silence, whether it's silence from radio pollution or light pollution or whatever.
and it was very obvious that, if we destroy these silent places on earth, we will be stuck on a planet without the ability to look outwards, because we will not be able to understand the signals that come from outer space.
