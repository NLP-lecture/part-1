[ Note ] : The poet used a thousand feet in the pool to compare the friendship between Wang Lun and him ,
and used exaggerated techniques ( thousand feet in the pool is not true ) to write about the deep friendship , which is very moving .
This poem embodies the poetic characteristics of romantic poet Li Bai wanting to fall into the sky .
--Quoted from " China Youth Net " http : / / www.cycnet.com.cn / [ 1 ] Wang Lun : residents near Taohuatan . [ 2 ] Tread Song : Sing and beat with your feet . [ 3 ] Taohuatan : in today 's Jingxian County , Anhui .
This is a farewell poem that has been passed down through the ages . Li Bai was about to leave Taohuatan by boat , and his friend Wang Lun sang affectionately to see him off . Tianbao fourteen years ( 755 ) , Li Bai traveled from Qiupu ( now Guichi , Anhui ) to Jingxian ( now Anhui ) to visit the Taohuatan . The local Wang Lun often brewed fine wine to entertain him . Before leaving , Wang Lun came to see him off again , and Li Bai wrote this poem to leave . The first half of poem is narrative : first write about the person who is going to leave , and then write about the person who is going to leave , showing a picture of parting . The initial sentence " ride a boat " indicates that it is a waterway ; " will want to go " indicates that it is when the boat is about to set off . This sentence makes us seem to see Li Bai saying goodbye to people on the boat about to leave the shore . Who is the sender ? The second sentence is not as straightforward as the first sentence . Instead , it uses a melody to say that the singing is heard . A group of villagers stepped on the ground for the beat , and sang as they walked to see them off . This seemed to be unexpected by Li Bai , so he said " suddenly heard " instead of " remotely heard . " Although the poem is relatively subtle , only the sound is heard and the person is not seen , but the person is ready to express it . The second half of the poem is lyrical . The third sentence is followed by a distant sentence , further explaining that the place of releasing the ship is Taohuatan . " Shen Qianchi " not only depicts the characteristics of Tan , but also presupposes the conclusion . The water in the Peach Blossom Pool is so deep and deep , it even touched the feelings of Li Ren , unforgettable Wang Lun 's affectionate and kindness , and the water is deeply and naturally connected . The concluding sentence bursts out " Not as good as Wang Lun 's sentiment to me , " and vividly expresses the sincere and pure affection with a metaphor . The lake is already " thousand feet deep , " so how deep is the friendship that Wang Lun gave to Li Bai ? Intriguing . Qing Shen Deqian admired this sentence very much . He said : " If Wang Lun 's love is more than a thousand feet in a pond , it is ordinary . The wonderland is only in the transition . " ( " Tang Poetry " ) Obviously , the beauty lies in the beauty . The good thing about the word " less than " is that it does not use metaphors but adopts the method of comparison to transform the invisible friendship into a vivid image , ethereal and aftertaste , natural and true . This little poem is deeply appreciated by future generations , and " Peach Blossom Pool Water " has become a common language for future generations to express their affection . Because of this poem , there are many beautiful legends and relics for tourists to visit in the Taohuatan area , such as the Tage 'an Pavilion on the east bank with the title " Tagge Ancient Shore " , and the Diaoyintai under the rainbow rock wall on the west bank .
