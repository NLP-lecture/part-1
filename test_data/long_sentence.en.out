[ Note ] : The poet used a thousand feet in the pool to compare the friendship between Wang Lun and him ,
and used exaggerated techniques ( thousand feet in the pool is not true ) to write about the deep friendship , which is very moving .
This poem embodies the poetic characteristics of romantic poet Li Bai wanting to fall into the sky .
